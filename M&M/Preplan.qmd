The template Benidorm (Lorca Marin, Murcia, Spain), Figure 1, born out of the idea to combine technical advantages of MUPIT, intrauterine probe, and imaging advantages of MRI-based brachytherapy, while preserving the stability, geometry, and robustness of the implant. The design allows covering any desired volume in gynecological cancer from distal vagina to uterus and distal parametrium, avoiding possible errors of free-hand needle placement. This device is constructed using a template, which is fixed to the perineum, allowing the employment of titanium needles and an intrauterine component to provide a central brachytherapy dose [9,10,11]. The template consists in two perineal plates with two central holes, allowing placement of a vaginal cylinder (available in different sizes) to accommodate different vaginal lengths. These cylinders can also engage different intrauterine tubes of varying angles and lenghts. Additionally, the plates are drilled with 12 rows of holes, with 1.1 cm apart, to introduce straight and angled titanium needles 1.9 mm in diameter and 200 mm length. The plates have three dimples where A-vitamin pellets are placed as a recognizable fiducial marker in MRI to be used in the reconstruction process. The number, location, and depth of the needles are decided by the physician, and they are customized for each patient.

The MRI scans of the patients were acquired with a 1.5 T MRI imager (Optima MRI 450w, software version DV24, GE Medical Systems Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). An eight-channel phased array receiver coil was employed, according to standard clinical MRI protocols. Following the GEC-ESTRO recommendations [1,2,3], the acquisition consists on axial T2 weighted fast recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) sequence, with a slice thickness reduced to 2 mm. This sequence is used for both delineating and reconstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition setting details were included in a previous publication from Richart et al. [11].

An applicator library has been specifically developed for this applicator, using free available software [12] (Figure 1). The anchor points are three inserted A-vitamin pellets. This library is feasible and very efficient; thus saving time, significantly reducing needle identification errors and avoiding uncertainty. It allows to solve all the steps involved in the treatment planning (contouring, reconstruction, and optimization) in just a MRI T2 sequence mainly in saving time.

The implemented pre-planning procedure is as follow: 1: Pre-brachytherapy MRI T2 acquisition is carried out with the template in place just with the vaginal cylinder (without uterine tube and needles) 3-5 days prior to brachytherapy implant. A vaginal obturator of a known length (40, 60, 100, or 130 mm according to the vaginal length) is introduced and the bladder is filled with 50 cc of saline solution. 2: On this image set, the CTV is drawn. Clinical and image gross target volume (GTV) at diagnosis and the GTV at the time of the brachytherapy were unified in a single CTV (including GTV, high-risk CTV [CTV HR R] and intermediate-risk CTV [CTV IR ]), based on GEC ESTRO recommendations [13,14,15]. The required needles and their depths are selected to encompass CTV (as conformal as possible). To facilitate this task, a Java based application linked to the treatment planning system (TPS) (Oncentra Prostate version 4.3, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) has been developed. From this procedure, each needle identification and its depth is obtained previously to the implant. 3: With this information, radiation oncologist proceeds with implantation and then, a post-implant MRI is performed, in which the contouring, needles plus tandem reconstruction, and optimization are stablished.
