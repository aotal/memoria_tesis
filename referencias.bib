  abstract = {The current clinical practice for cervical cancer intracavitary brachytherapy in most centers is to prescribe the dose to point A. However, this is an empirical point and does not necessarily reflect dose to the tumor. Although 3-dimensional image-based treatment planning is extensively used in prostate brachytherapy, only a few institutions have used it to shape the dose distribution in cervical brachytherapy. To facilitate and standardize image-based dosimetry for cervical cancer brachytherapy, the American Image-guided Brachytherapy Working Group and the European Gynecological GEC-ESTRO Working Group have recently proposed nomenclature for volume definition and recommendations for image-based intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer. The recommendations of the 2 groups are very similar and are discussed together in this article. Proposals are made for research in image-based brachytherapy for cervical cancer. At a recent transatlantic image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy workshop (Chicago, IL, July 28, 2005), it was suggested that because the recommendations are so similar and to prevent confusion, the nomenclature suggested by the European Group be adopted and future joint contouring workshops be organized to facilitate image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brachytherapy (BT) plays a crucial role in the management of invasive cervix cancer from stage I to IV. Intracavitary techniques are based on afterloading devices, with different types of applicators. CT and/or MRI compatible applicators allow a sectional image based approach with a better assessment of gross tumour volume (GTV) and definition and delineation of target volume (CTV) compared to traditional approaches. Accurate and reproducible delineation of GTV, CTV and PTV, as well as of critical organs has a direct impact on BT treatment planning, especially if it is possible to adapt the pear-shape isodose by optimisation using DVH analysis. When introducing a 3D image based approach for GTV and CTV assessment, there is a need for a common language to describe the concepts and to define the terms which are to be used. METHODS: In 2000, GEC-ESTRO decided to support 3D imaging based 3D treatment planning approach in cervix cancer BT with the creation of a Working Group. The task was to describe basic concepts and terms and to work out a terminology enabling various groups working in this advanced field to use a common language. The recommendations described in this report were proposed based on clinical experience and dosimetric concepts of different institutions (IGR, Leuven, Vienna) and were stepwise validated against the background of different clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: As GTV and CTV for BT change significantly during treatment, time frame for assessment of GTV and CTV for BT is specified in this report: at time of diagnosis GTV(D), CTV(D) and at time of BT GTV(B), CTV(B). Furthermore, CTV for BT is defined related to risk for recurrence: high risk CTV and intermediate risk CTV. Beside verbal descriptions detailed examples are given, partly in form of schematic drawings.},

  abstract = {The second part of the GYN GEC ESTRO working group recommendations is focused on 3D dose-volume parameters for brachytherapy of cervical carcinoma. Methods and parameters have been developed and validated from dosimetric, imaging and clinical experience from different institutions (University of Vienna, IGR Paris, University of Leuven). Cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH) are recommended for evaluation of the complex dose heterogeneity. DVH parameters for GTV, HR CTV and IR CTV are the minimum dose delivered to 90 and 100\% of the respective volume: D90, D100. The volume, which is enclosed by 150 or 200\% of the prescribed dose (V150, V200), is recommended for overall assessment of high dose volumes. V100 is recommended for quality assessment only within a given treatment schedule. For Organs at Risk (OAR) the minimum dose in the most irradiated tissue volume is recommended for reporting: 0.1, 1, and 2 cm3; optional 5 and 10 cm3. Underlying assumptions are: full dose of external beam therapy in the volume of interest, identical location during fractionated brachytherapy, contiguous volumes and contouring of organ walls for {$>$}2 cm3. Dose values are reported as absorbed dose and also taking into account different dose rates. The linear-quadratic radiobiological model-equivalent dose (EQD2)-is applied for brachytherapy and is also used for calculating dose from external beam therapy. This formalism allows systematic assessment within one patient, one centre and comparison between different centres with analysis of dose volume relations for GTV, CTV, and OAR. Recommendations for the transition period from traditional to 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy are formulated. Supplementary data (available in the electronic version of this paper) deals with aspects of 3D imaging, radiation physics, radiation biology, dose at reference points and dimensions and volumes for the GTV and CTV (adding to [Haie-Meder C, P\"otter R, Van Limbergen E et al. Recommendations from Gynaecological (GYN) GEC ESTRO Working Group (I): concepts and terms in 3D image-based 3D treatment planning in cervix cancer brachytherapy with emphasis on MRI assessment of GTV and CTV. Radiother Oncol 2005;74:235-245]). It is expected that the therapeutic ratio including target coverage and sparing of organs at risk can be significantly improved, if radiation dose is prescribed to a 3D image-based CTV taking into account dose volume constraints for OAR. However, prospective use of these recommendations in the clinical context is warranted, to further explore and develop the potential of 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of 2D conventional brachytherapy (CBT) compared to 3D MRI-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) with and without the use of interstitial needles on local control, overall survival, and toxicity in patients treated for cervical cancer with radiation or chemoradiation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of biopsy-proven FIGO IB-IVA cervical cancer patients, treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation, followed by brachytherapy (BT) between January 1997 and July 2016. Endpoints were local control, overall survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: Of 126 patients included, 35 have been treated with CBT, 31 with IGBT without needles (IC), and 60 with IGBT with needles (ICIS). External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) had mostly been delivered concurrently with chemotherapy (weekly cisplatin). Overall local control was 93\% after 1 year, and 88\% after 3 years. Overall 3-year survival was 75\%, and 5-year survival was 66\%. The 3D technique (IGBT cohorts) showed a trend for an improved local control and overall survival (p = 0.05) compared to the 2D technique (CBT cohort). A decrease in toxicity was observed from 17\% (2D cohort) to 12\% (3D cohort). The use of interstitial needles was associated with a higher high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) dose (11.3 Gy vs. 9.9 Gy) and a lower D(2cc) bladder dose (10.9 Gy vs. 14.7 Gy, both p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In cervical cancer treatment, the use of a 3D brachytherapy technique (MRI-guided with or without interstitial needles) showed a trend towards an increased local control and improved overall survival with reduced toxicity, compared to the conventional 2D brachytherapy technique. The use of interstitial needles allowed dose sculpting, resulting in delivery of higher doses to the HR-CTV, while reducing radiation doses to organs at risk, such as the bladder.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the intrafractional movements of organs at risk (OARs) and their dosimetric impact during the delivery of pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy in cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An MRI on Day 1 was used for treatment planning in 19 patients. CT scans were acquired at Days 1, 2, and 3 with delineation of the OARs. The MRI plan was transferred to each CT. The intersection volume between the 10 Gy isodose and the OARs were monitored, reflecting movement. Lower dose evaluated in the maximally exposed 0.1 cm(3) of an organ and lower dose evaluated in the maximally exposed 2 cm(3) of an organ (D(2cm3)) were evaluated on each CT and compared. Results were averaged considering that each CT reflected one-third of the treatment course to evaluate the delivered dose. RESULTS: No major movements of the sigmoid and bladder were observed, whereas the rectum got significantly closer to the implant at Day 2. The consequence was an increase of 6\% {$\pm$} 5.3 (3.7 Gy, {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} = 3 Gy) of the delivered D(2cm3) from the planned dose, in contrast to 0.2\% {$\pm$} 6.1 for the bladder and 1.1\% {$\pm$} 6.4 for the sigmoid. The increase of the D(2cm3) of the rectum was reported in 17 patients, ranging from 0.4 to 9.4 Gy, leading to a 10.5\% overcoming of the dose constraint (75 Gy). Similar tendencies were reported for lower dose evaluated in the maximally exposed 0.1 cm(3) of an organ. CONCLUSIONS: A significant systematic variation was observed for the rectum (+3.7 Gy). As significant random variations were observed, caution should be exercised when the planned D(2cm3) is close to the dose constraints.},

  abstract = {Brachytherapy plays an essential role in the curative intent management of locally advanced cervical cancer. The introduction of the magnetic resonance (MR) as a preferred image modality and the development of new type of applicators with interstitial components have further improved its benefits. The aim of this work is to review the current status of one important aspect in the cervix cancer brachytherapy procedure, namely catheter reconstruction. MR compatible intracavitary and interstitial applicators are described. Considerations about the use of MR imaging (MRI) regarding appropriate strategies for applicator reconstruction, technical requirements, MR sequences, patient preparation and applicator commissioning are included. It is recommendable to perform the reconstruction process in the same image study employed by the physician for contouring, that is, T2 weighted (T2W) sequences. Nevertheless, a clear identification of the source path inside the catheters and the applicators is a challenge when using exclusively T2W sequences. For the intracavitary component of the implant, sometimes the catheters may be filled with some substance that produces a high intensity signal on MRI. However, this strategy is not feasible for plastic tubes or titanium needles, which, moreover, induce magnetic susceptibility artifacts. In these situations, the use of applicator libraries available in the treatment planning system (TPS) is useful, since they not only include accurate geometrical models of the intracavitary applicators, but also recent developments have made possible the implementation of the interstitial component. Another strategy to improve the reconstruction process is based on the incorporation of MR markers, such as small pellets, to be used as anchor points. Many institutions employ computed tomography (CT) as a supporting image modality. The registration of CT and MR image sets should be carefully performed, and its uncertainty previously assessed. Besides, an important research work is being carried out regarding the use of ultrasound and electromagnetic tracking technologies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To study outcome and toxicity in 59 patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma treated with computed tomography (CT)-based Martinez universal perineal interstitial template (MUPIT) and the new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible template Benidorm (TB). MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 2005 to October 2015, we retrospectively analyzed 34 patients treated with MUPIT and 25 treated with the TB. Six 4 Gy fractions were prescribed to the clinical target volume (CTV) combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The organs at risk (OARs) and the CTV were delineated by CT scan in the MUPIT implants and by MRI in the TB implants. Dosimetry was CT-based for MUPIT and exclusively MRI-based for TB. Dose values were biologically normalized to equivalent doses in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). RESULTS: Median CTV volumes were 163.5 cm3 for CT-based MUPIT (range 81.8-329.4 cm3) and 91.9 cm3 for MRI-based TB (range 26.2-161 cm3). Median D90 CTV (EBRT + BT) was 75.8 Gy for CT-based MUPIT (range 69-82 Gy) and 78.6 Gy for MRI-based TB (range 62.5-84.2 Gy). Median D2cm3 for the rectum was 75.3 Gy for CT-based MUPIT (range 69.8-132.1 Gy) and 69.9 Gy for MRI-based TB (range 58.3-83.7 Gy). Median D2cm3 for the bladder was 79.8 Gy for CT-based MUPIT (range 71.2-121.1 Gy) and 77.1 Gy for MRI-based TB (range 60.5-90.8 Gy). Local control (LC) was 88\%. Overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), and LC were not statistically significant in either group. Patients treated with CT-based MUPIT had a significantly higher percentage of rectal bleeding G3 (p = 0.040) than those treated with MRI-based TB, 13\% vs. 2\%. CONCLUSIONS: Template Benidorm treatment using MRI-based dosimetry provides advantages of MRI volume definition, and allows definition of smaller volumes that result in statistically significant decreased rectal toxicity compared to that seen with CT-based MUPIT treatment.},
