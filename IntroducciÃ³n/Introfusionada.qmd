In recent decades, brachytherapy (BT), also known as Interventional Radiotherapy (IRT), has emerged as a cornerstone in the treatment of gynecological lesions, representing one of the most widely employed and successful therapeutic techniques for these conditions. Among gynecological BT applications, cervical cancer treatments have notably advanced. Numerous studies emphasize the pivotal role of intracavitary BT in achieving curative outcomes for locally advanced cervical cancer, often administered following external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with concurrent chemotherapy. This comprehensive approach has consistently demonstrated excellent rates of local disease control [1–3].

However, the landscape of cervical cancer treatment has evolved with the introduction of new EBRT techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), and Proton therapy (PT). Some trends in the United States have shown a shift toward exclusive EBRT treatments, although studies have indicated decreased cause-specific survival and overall survival in cases where BT is not incorporated [4]. Moreover, expert bodies like the Society of Gynaecologic Oncology (SGO), the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have collectively recommended against substituting conformal external beam therapies for brachytherapy in primary curative-intent radiation therapy for cervical cancer [6].

The Gynecological Working Group of the GEC ESTRO (GYN GEC-ESTRO), formed in 2000, has spearheaded the transition from 2D BT based on A points to 3D BT grounded in imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This shift introduces a novel approach to volume definition, accommodating the dynamic changes in tumor size and position during radio-chemotherapy response. Known as image-guided adaptive BT (IGABT) or 4D BT, this approach tailors the clinical target volume (CTV) to the evolving conditions surrounding each BT treatment session. The EMBRACE I study, a large-scale prospective investigation, was pivotal in establishing the safety and efficacy of MRI-based IGABT for cervical carcinoma treatment [20]. GEC ESTRO's recommendations, spanning I to IV, have been widely adopted as the foundation for implementing IGABT globally, now incorporated into the ICRU 89 guidelines [21].

Utilizing MRI for planning has revealed the benefits of combining interstitial techniques with intracavitary BT, offering improved dose conformity and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Additionally, it permits the flexibility to select from various combined applicator options depending on the manufacturer [22,23]. Prescription and reporting have evolved from the traditional 2D dose points (e.g., A points) to metrics grounded in Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) and patient-specific anatomical considerations derived from 3D images [24]. The latest GEC-ESTRO recommendations have been incorporated into the ongoing EMBRACE II study, aiming to optimize local control, minimize toxicity, and define high-risk patient profiles. This involves exploring external radiotherapy techniques like IMRT/VMAT, increased lymph node dose with integrated boost, and greater utilization of interstitial BT within IGABT.

In the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, a typical regimen involves pelvic EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy followed by BT. EBRT is usually administered at doses of 45–50 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy fractions, with potential boosts to lymph nodes, parametria, or the pelvic sidewall, tailored to the clinical scenario and center's expertise. The 28 Gy in 4 fractions HDR-BT scheme has become established due to the EMBRACE trials, often delivered in two applications over 1–2 weeks, maintaining an overall treatment time below 50–55 days for optimal local control [27].

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the biological effects of EBRT and BT fractions, the Equivalent Dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) is used, accounting for tumor and normal tissue effects. EQD2, following the ICRU 89 recommendations, has become the standard for reporting dose for planning, prescriptions, and actual delivery [21]. Clinical departments often employ external tools, like the GEC-ESTRO spreadsheet, to calculate EQD2 values for individual patients, as current BT treatment planning systems do not fully consider CTV-OAR dose balance during optimization, relying heavily on physicist expertise.

Ideally, applicator geometry should be reconstructed in the same MRI study where the radiation oncologist defines CTV and OAR volumes. However, challenges arise when using dummies to identify potential interstitial source trajectories due to void signals from air-filled applicators. Consequently, complementary image modalities may be needed to aid in the reconstruction process.

The primary aim of this work is to review the methodologies employed by commercially available BT treatment planning systems to address key planning challenges in exclusive-MRI-based cervical BT with interstitial components. Furthermore, we outline practical aspects that would enhance future TPS versions, from both radiation oncologist and medical physicist perspectives.

Traditionally, T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the preferred modality for guiding BT procedures in cervical cancer [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. The historical use of solely endocavitary applicators, such as uterine tandems with ovoids/colpostats or rings, has been challenged by MRI's revelation of the limitations in clinical target volume (CTV) coverage by these intracavitary tools. As a response, innovative applicators with interstitial components have been developed, such as the Vienna applicator and the Utrecht applicator, both offering plastic needles for enhanced dose delivery [11,12].

In cases of locally advanced cervical carcinoma extending moderately to the parametrium, the combined use of endocavitary and interstitial applicators proves effective. However, when dealing with extensive disease affecting the distal vagina and/or parametrium, interstitial treatments are recommended [6,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Institutions have even developed their own solutions, like the Template Benidorm (TB), a fully MRI-compatible applicator, offering the flexibility to combine intracavitary brachytherapy with transperineal interstitial needles based on the patient's specific needs [17].

Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie and European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) have provided recommendations for commissioning and applicator reconstruction in MRI-based cervix cancer brachytherapy [10]. They have also acknowledged the challenges posed by MRI compared to computed tomography (CT), particularly regarding applicator reconstruction and the limited availability of commercial MRI-compatible dummy sources.

Notably, recent advancements in treatment planning systems (TPS) from companies like Nucletron (an Elekta company, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) have introduced applicator libraries, enabling more accurate and efficient reconstruction based on anchor points. However, such libraries are yet to encompass the interstitial components of the Utrecht and TB applicators, which rely on patient-specific needle arrangements.

In summary, the consensus among professional societies and the growing body of evidence support the shift towards MRI-based IGABT for cervical carcinoma treatment. This approach offers superior precision in CTV definition and dosimetry. While challenges persist, particularly in applicator reconstruction and planning system capabilities, ongoing research and technological advancements hold the promise of further improving outcomes

 for these patients.
