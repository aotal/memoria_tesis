The interstitial component library that has been developed for the Utrecht applicator and TB is feasible and efficient, saving time and improving accuracy. It allows all the required treatment planning (contouring, reconstruction, and optimization) to proceed using just a T2 MRI sequence. The additional use of specific free available software applications makes it possible to add this information to the already existing library of the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS. Specific details not included on this manuscript will be available under request. This library is also currently being implemented also into the Sagiplan v 2.0 TPS (Eckert & Ziegler, BEBIG).
