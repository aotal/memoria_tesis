  abstract = {We evaluated the impact of model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) on high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) treatment planning for patients with cervical cancer. Seven patients with cervical cancer treated using HDR-BT were studied. Tandem and ovoid applicators were used in four patients, a vaginal cylinder in one, and interstitial needles in the remaining two patients. MBDCAs were applied to the Advanced Collapsed cone Engine (ACE; Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). All plans, which were originally calculated using TG-43, were re-calculated using both ACE and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Air was used as the rectal material. The mean difference in the rectum D2cm3 between ACErec-air and MCrec-air was 8.60 {$\pm$} 4.64\%, whereas that in the bladder D2cm3 was -2.80 {$\pm$} 1.21\%. Conversely, in the small group analysis (n = 4) using water instead of air as the rectal material, the mean difference in the rectum D2cm3 between TG-43 and ACErec-air was 11.87 {$\pm$} 2.65\%, whereas that between TG-43 and ACErec-water was 0.81 {$\pm$} 2.04\%, indicating that the use of water as the rectal material reduced the difference in D2cm3 between TG-43 and ACE. Our results suggested that the differences in the dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters of TG-43 and ACE were large for the rectum when considerable air (gas) volume was present in it, and that this difference was reduced when the air (gas) volume was reduced. Also, ACE exhibited better dose calculation accuracy than that of TG-43 in this situation. Thus, ACE may be able to calculate the dose more accurately than TG-43 for HDR-BT in treating cervical cancers, particularly for patients with considerable air (gas) volume in the rectum.},

  abstract = {Needle insertion in soft tissue has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its application in minimally invasive percutaneous procedures such as biopsies and brachytherapy. This paper presents a survey of the current state of research on needle insertion in soft tissue. It examines the topic from several aspects, e.g. modeling needle insertion forces, modeling tissue deformation and needle deflection during insertion, robot-assisted needle insertion, and the effect of different trajectories on tissue deformation. All studies show that the axial force of a needle during insertion in soft tissue is the summation of different forces distributed along the needle shaft such as stiffness force, frictional force and cutting force. Some studies have modeled these forces. The force data in some procedures is used for identifying tissue layers as the needle is inserted or for path planning. Needle deflection and tissue deformation are major problems for accurate needle insertion and attempts have been made to model them. Using current models several insertion techniques have been developed which are briefly reviewed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop, and evaluate the performance of, a deep learning-based three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm aimed at finding needles in ultrasound images used in prostate brachytherapy. Methods Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image volumes from 1102 treatments were used to create a clinical ground truth (CGT) including 24422 individual needles that had been manually digitized by medical physicists during brachytherapy procedures. A 3D CNN U-net with 128 \texttimes{} 128 \texttimes{} 128 TRUS image volumes as input was trained using 17215 needle examples. Predictions of voxels constituting a needle were combined to yield a 3D linear function describing the localization of each needle in a TRUS volume. Manual and AI digitizations were compared in terms of the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) along each needle, expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). The method was evaluated on a data set including 7207 needle examples. A subgroup of the evaluation data set (n = 188) was created, where the needles were digitized once more by a medical physicist (G1) trained in brachytherapy. The digitization procedure was timed. Results The RMSD between the AI and CGT was 0.55 (IQR: 0.35\textendash 0.86) mm. In the smaller subset, the RMSD between AI and CGT was similar (0.52 [IQR: 0.33\textendash 0.79] mm) but significantly smaller (P {$<$} 0.001) than the difference of 0.75 (IQR: 0.49\textendash 1.20) mm between AI and G1. The difference between CGT and G1 was 0.80 (IQR: 0.48\textendash 1.18) mm, implying that the AI performed as well as the CGT in relation to G1. The mean time needed for human digitization was 10 min 11 sec, while the time needed for the AI was negligible. Conclusions A 3D CNN can be trained to identify needles in TRUS images. The performance of the network was similar to that of a medical physicist trained in brachytherapy. Incorporating a CNN for needle identification can shorten brachytherapy treatment procedures substantially.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Variations in organ position, shape, and volume cause uncertainties in dose assessment for brachytherapy (BT) in cervix cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate uncertainties associated with bladder dose accumulation based on DVH parameter addition (previously called "the worst case assumption") in fractionated BT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients treated for locally advanced cervical cancer were included. All patients received EBRT combined with two individually planned 3D image-guided adaptive BT fractions. D(2cm(3)) and D(0.1cm(3)) were estimated by DVH parameter addition and compared to dose accumulations based on an in-house developed biomechanical deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm. RESULTS: DIR-based DVH analysis was possible in 42/47 patients. DVH parameter addition resulted in mean dose deviations relative to DIR of 0.4{$\pm$}0.3 Gy({$\alpha\beta$}3) (1.5{$\pm$}1.8\%) and 1.9{$\pm$}1.6 Gy({$\alpha\beta$}3) (5.2{$\pm$}4.2\%) for D(2cm(3)) and D(0.1cm(3)), respectively. Dose deviations greater than 5\% occurred in 2\% and 38\% of the patients for D(2cm(3)) and D(0.1cm(3)), respectively. Visual inspection of the dose distributions showed that hotspots were located in the same region of the bladder during both BT fractions for the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: DVH parameter addition provides a good estimate for D(2cm(3)), whereas D(0.1cm(3)) is less robust to this approximation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate critical structure movement and subsequent dose received during conformal MR-guided cervix brachytherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 patients (36 HDR fractions) undergoing brachytherapy for cervical cancer underwent a second MR immediately prior to treatment (pre-treatment MR). Bowel (including sigmoid), bladder and rectum were outlined on both planning and pre-treatment MR scans and dosimetry compared. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the volumes of the OAR doses across the two scans but there were large variations between patients with differences of up to 3.3 Gy observed. The percentage of fractions for which D2cc was within 10\% of that planned was 61.1\%, 41.7\% and 47.2\% for bladder, rectum and bowel, respectively. The average time between MR scans was found to be 4.75 h (SD{$\pm$}1.2; range 3.2-9.9 h), with no correlation found with critical structure movement within this range. CONCLUSIONS: OAR movement is difficult to predict though significant changes occur in individual patients. In 61\% of cases in our sample the D2cc dose changed by at least 10\% for at least one OAR from that planned. Pre-treatment imaging with subsequent adjustment of dosimetry will minimise the impact of organ movement on delivered dose.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning is limited by the fact that the electron density distribution required for dose calculation is not readily provided by MR imaging. We compare a selection of novel synthetic CT generation algorithms recently reported in the literature, including segmentation-based, atlas-based and machine learning techniques, using the same cohort of patients and quantitative evaluation metrics. METHODS: Six MRI-guided synthetic CT generation algorithms were evaluated: one segmentation technique into a single tissue class (water-only), four atlas-based techniques, namely, median value of atlas images (ALMedian), atlas-based local weighted voting (ALWV), bone enhanced atlas-based local weighted voting (ALWV-Bone), iterative atlas-based local weighted voting (ALWV-Iter), and a machine learning technique using deep convolution neural network (DCNN). RESULTS: Organ auto-contouring from MR images was evaluated for bladder, rectum, bones, and body boundary. Overall, DCNN exhibited higher segmentation accuracy resulting in Dice indices (DSC) of 0.93 {$\pm$} 0.17, 0.90 {$\pm$} 0.04, and 0.93 {$\pm$} 0.02 for bladder, rectum, and bones, respectively. On the other hand, ALMedian showed the lowest accuracy with DSC of 0.82 {$\pm$} 0.20, 0.81 {$\pm$} 0.08, and 0.88 {$\pm$} 0.04, respectively. DCNN reached the best performance in terms of accurate derivation of synthetic CT values within each organ, with a mean absolute error within the body contour of 32.7 {$\pm$} 7.9 HU, followed by the advanced atlas-based methods (ALWV: 40.5 {$\pm$} 8.2 HU, ALWV-Iter: 42.4 {$\pm$} 8.1 HU, ALWV-Bone: 44.0 {$\pm$} 8.9 HU). ALMedian led to the highest error (52.1 {$\pm$} 11.1 HU). Considering the dosimetric evaluation results, ALWV-Iter, ALWV, DCNN and ALWV-Bone led to similar mean dose estimation within each organ at risk and target volume with less than 1\% dose discrepancy. However, the two-dimensional gamma analysis demonstrated higher pass rates for ALWV-Bone, DCNN, ALMedian and ALWV-Iter at 1\%/1 mm criterion with 94.99 {$\pm$} 5.15\%, 94.59 {$\pm$} 5.65\%, 93.68 {$\pm$} 5.53\% and 93.10 {$\pm$} 5.99\% success, respectively, while ALWV and water-only resulted in 86.91 {$\pm$} 13.50\% and 80.77 {$\pm$} 12.10\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, machine learning and advanced atlas-based methods exhibited promising performance by achieving reliable organ segmentation and synthetic CT generation. DCNN appears to have slightly better performance by achieving accurate automated organ segmentation and relatively small dosimetric errors (followed closely by advanced atlas-based methods, which in some cases achieved similar performance). However, the DCNN approach showed higher vulnerability to anatomical variation, where a greater number of outliers was observed with this method. Considering the dosimetric results obtained from the evaluated methods, the challenge of electron density estimation from MR images can be resolved with a clinically tolerable error.},

  abstract = {The charge of Task Group 186 (TG-186) is to provide guidance for early adopters of model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) for brachytherapy (BT) dose calculations to ensure practice uniformity. Contrary to external beam radiotherapy, heterogeneity correction algorithms have only recently been made available to the BT community. Yet, BT dose calculation accuracy is highly dependent on scatter conditions and photoelectric effect cross-sections relative to water. In specific situations, differences between the current water-based BT dose calculation formalism (TG-43) and MBDCAs can lead to differences in calculated doses exceeding a factor of 10. MBDCAs raise three major issues that are not addressed by current guidance documents: (1) MBDCA calculated doses are sensitive to the dose specification medium, resulting in energy-dependent differences between dose calculated to water in a homogeneous water geometry (TG-43), dose calculated to the local medium in the heterogeneous medium, and the intermediate scenario of dose calculated to a small volume of water in the heterogeneous medium. (2) MBDCA doses are sensitive to voxel-by-voxel interaction cross sections. Neither conventional single-energy CT nor ICRU/ICRP tissue composition compilations provide useful guidance for the task of assigning interaction cross sections to each voxel. (3) Since each patient-source-applicator combination is unique, having reference data for each possible combination to benchmark MBDCAs is an impractical strategy. Hence, a new commissioning process is required. TG-186 addresses in detail the above issues through the literature review and provides explicit recommendations based on the current state of knowledge. TG-43-based dose prescription and dose calculation remain in effect, with MBDCA dose reporting performed in parallel when available. In using MBDCAs, it is recommended that the radiation transport should be performed in the heterogeneous medium and, at minimum, the dose to the local medium be reported along with the TG-43 calculated doses. Assignments of voxel-by-voxel cross sections represent a particular challenge. Electron density information is readily extracted from CT imaging, but cannot be used to distinguish between different materials having the same density. Therefore, a recommendation is made to use a number of standardized materials to maintain uniformity across institutions. Sensitivity analysis shows that this recommendation offers increased accuracy over TG-43. MBDCA commissioning will share commonalities with current TG-43-based systems, but in addition there will be algorithm-specific tasks. Two levels of commissioning are recommended: reproducing TG-43 dose parameters and testing the advanced capabilities of MBDCAs. For validation of heterogeneity and scatter conditions, MBDCAs should mimic the 3D dose distributions from reference virtual geometries. Potential changes in BT dose prescriptions and MBDCA limitations are discussed. When data required for full MBDCA implementation are insufficient, interim recommendations are made and potential areas of research are identified. Application of TG-186 guidance should retain practice uniformity in transitioning from the TG-43 to the MBDCA approach.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: For the purpose of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, a prototype magnetic resonance (MR) conditional afterloader was developed. This study demonstrates the development and testing of the prototype, while operating simultaneously with MRI. In combination with an MR-based method for HDR source localization, this development enables treatment verification of HDR brachytherapy. Additionally, this allows a direct reconstruction of the source dwell positions after catheter insertion (when using a dummy source) and introduction of a clinical workflow where the patient remains in the same position during dwell position reconstruction, treatment planning and irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prototype MR conditional afterloader was developed by providing radiofrequency (RF) shielding and a plastic source cable containing a dummy source. Simultaneous functioning of the afterloader and MRI acquisition was tested in an experimental setting where the afterloader was placed next to the scanner and programmed to send the source to predefined positions within a phantom, while acquiring MR images. The HDR source positions were determined using MR artifact simulation and matching of the MR images to the simulated artifact. Additionally, the impact of the presence and use of the afterloader on the MRI performance was investigated by assessment of RF interference, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and B0 field homogeneity. RESULTS: The experiments demonstrated that the prototype MR conditional afterloader and the MRI scanner fully functioned while operating simultaneously, without influencing the other system. The step sizes between the source positions obtained from the MR images corresponded with the afterloader settings. Besides, the MRI performance tests demonstrated no deterioration due to the presence or functioning of the afterloader next to the scanner. CONCLUSIONS: This research has demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneous MR acquisition and employment of an MR conditional afterloader. This development enables real-time HDR source localization for treatment verification of MRI-guided HDR brachytherapy using an MR conditional afterloader.},

MR-based localization of an HDR source serves two main aims. First, it enables real-time treatment verification by determination of the HDR source positions during treatment. Second, when using a dummy source, MR-based source localization provides an automatic detection of the source dwell positions after catheter insertion, allowing elimination of the catheter reconstruction procedure. Localization of the HDR source was conducted by simulation of the MR artifacts, followed by a phase correlation localization algorithm applied to the MR images and the simulated images, to determine the position of the HDR source in the MR images. To increase the temporal resolution of the MR acquisition, the spatial resolution was decreased, and a subpixel localization operation was introduced. Furthermore, parallel imaging (sensitivity encoding) was applied to further decrease the MR scan time. The localization method was validated by a comparison with CT, and the accuracy and precision were investigated. The results demonstrated that the described method could be used to determine the HDR source position with a high accuracy (0.4-0.6\,mm) and a high precision ({$\leqslant$}0.1\,mm), at high temporal resolutions (0.15-1.2\,s per slice). This would enable real-time treatment verification as well as an automatic detection of the source dwell positions.},

Materials and methods Optical measurements of transparent ring-phantoms provided the geometric relation between source path and the Vienna ring applicator as visible on MRI. For the manual direct reconstruction method (PLATO), the geometry plotted on a transparency was placed on the screen and rotated to fit with visible ring holes. With the software-integrated reconstruction method (OncentraGYN), the applicator geometry was directly used when placing the visible parts of the applicator in the 3D dataset. Clinical feasibility was tested in 10 clinical insertions. Reconstruction and dose calculation were performed independently on two treatment planning systems (PLATO and OncentraGYN) using MRI alone. DVH parameters for targets and organs at risk were analysed and compared to the clinically used radiograph/MRI registration-based method. Results The direct reconstruction concept for both methods was feasible and reduced treatment planning time. Evaluated DVH parameters for plans using direct reconstruction methods differed from clinically used plans (traditional reconstruction) in mean differences {$\leqslant$}0.2\hspace{0.25em}Gy for plans with 7\hspace{0.25em}Gy prescribed dose. Conclusion If the relation between applicator shape visible on MRI and the source path is defined once, the reconstruction process can be performed by directly placing the applicator in the MRI dataset.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In radiotherapy, MRI is used for target volume and organs-at-risk delineation for its superior soft-tissue contrast as compared to CT imaging. However, MRI does not provide the electron density of tissue necessary for dose calculation. Several methods of synthetic-CT (sCT) generation from MRI data have been developed for radiotherapy dose calculation. This work reviewed deep learning (DL) sCT generation methods and their associated image and dose evaluation, in the context of MRI-based dose calculation. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and ScienceDirect electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2021. For each paper, several items were screened and compiled in figures and tables. RESULTS: This review included 57 studies. The DL methods were either generator-only based (45\% of the reviewed studies), or generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture and its variants (55\% of the reviewed studies). The brain and pelvis were the most commonly investigated anatomical localizations (39\% and 28\% of the reviewed studies, respectively), and more rarely, the head-and-neck (H\&N) (15\%), abdomen (10\%), liver (5\%) or breast (3\%). All the studies performed an image evaluation of sCTs with a diversity of metrics, with only 36 studies performing dosimetric evaluations of sCT. CONCLUSIONS: The median mean absolute errors were around 76 HU for the brain and H\&N sCTs and 40 HU for the pelvis sCTs. For the brain, the mean dose difference between the sCT and the reference CT was {$<$}2\%. For the H\&N and pelvis, the mean dose difference was below 1\% in most of the studies. Recent GAN architectures have advantages compared to generator-only, but no superiority was found in term of image or dose sCT uncertainties. Key challenges of DL-based sCT generation methods from MRI in radiotherapy is the management of movement for abdominal and thoracic localizations, the standardization of sCT evaluation, and the investigation of multicenter impacts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite significant advances in the screening, detection, and treatment of preinvasive cervical lesions, invasive cervical cancer is the fifth most common cancer in European women. There are large disparities in Europe and worldwide in the incidence, management, and mortality of cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) jointly develop clinically relevant and evidence-based guidelines in order to improve the quality of care for women with cervical cancer across Europe and worldwide. METHODS: The ESGO/ESTRO/ESP nominated an international multidisciplinary development group consisting of practicing clinicians and researchers who have demonstrated leadership and expertise in the care and research of cervical cancer (23 experts across Europe). To ensure that the guidelines are evidence based, the current literature identified from a systematic search was reviewed and critically appraised. In the absence of any clear scientific evidence, judgment was based on the professional experience and consensus of the development group. The guidelines are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement. Prior to publication, the guidelines were reviewed by 159 international reviewers, selected through ESGO/ESTRO/ESP and including patient representatives. RESULTS: The guidelines cover comprehensively staging, management, and follow-up for patients with cervical cancer. Management includes fertility sparing treatment; stage T1a, T1b1/T2a1, clinically occult cervical cancer diagnosed after simple hysterectomy; early and locally advanced cervical cancer; primary distant metastatic disease; cervical cancer in pregnancy; and recurrent disease. Principles of radiotherapy and pathological evaluation are defined.},

The course provides essential mathematical background as well as a large array of real-world examples. It also provides a short survey of the most relevant recent developments in digital geometry processing and discrete differential geometry. Compared to previous SIGGRAPH courses, this course focuses heavily on practical aspects of DEC, with an emphasis on implementation and applications. The course begins with the core ideas from exterior calculus, in both the smooth and discrete setting. Then it shows how a large number of fundamental geometry-processing tools (smoothing, parameterization, geodesics, mesh optimization, etc.) can be implemented quickly, robustly, and efficiently within this single common framework. It concludes with a discussion of recent extensions of DEC that improve efficiency, accuracy, and versatility. The course notes grew out of the discrete differential geometry course taught over the past five years at the California Institute of Technology, for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in computer science, applied mathematics, and associated fields. The notes also provide guided exercises (both written and coding) that attendees can later use to deepen their understanding of the material.},

  abstract = {Over the last years, technological innovation in Radiotherapy (RT) led to the introduction of Magnetic Resonance-guided RT (MRgRT) systems. Due to the higher soft tissue contrast compared to on-board CT-based systems, MRgRT is expected to significantly improve the treatment in many situations. MRgRT systems may extend the management of inter- and intra-fraction anatomical changes, offering the possibility of online adaptation of the dose distribution according to daily patient anatomy and to directly monitor tumor motion during treatment delivery by means of a continuous cine MR acquisition. Online adaptive treatments require a multidisciplinary and well-trained team, able to perform a series of operations in a safe, precise and fast manner while the patient is waiting on the treatment couch. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to rapidly contribute to MRgRT, primarily by safely and efficiently automatising the various manual operations characterizing online adaptive treatments. Furthermore, AI is finding relevant applications in MRgRT in the fields of image segmentation, synthetic CT reconstruction, automatic (on-line) planning and the development of predictive models based on daily MRI. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current AI integration in MRgRT from a medical physicist's perspective. Medical physicists are expected to be major actors in solving new tasks and in taking new responsibilities: their traditional role of guardians of the new technology implementation will change with increasing emphasis on the managing of AI tools, processes and advanced systems for imaging and data analysis, gradually replacing many repetitive manual tasks.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of biopsy-proven FIGO IB-IVA cervical cancer patients, treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation, followed by brachytherapy (BT) between January 1997 and July 2016. Endpoints were local control, overall survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: Of 126 patients included, 35 have been treated with CBT, 31 with IGBT without needles (IC), and 60 with IGBT with needles (ICIS). External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) had mostly been delivered concurrently with chemotherapy (weekly cisplatin). Overall local control was 93\% after 1 year, and 88\% after 3 years. Overall 3-year survival was 75\%, and 5-year survival was 66\%. The 3D technique (IGBT cohorts) showed a trend for an improved local control and overall survival (p = 0.05) compared to the 2D technique (CBT cohort). A decrease in toxicity was observed from 17\% (2D cohort) to 12\% (3D cohort). The use of interstitial needles was associated with a higher high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) dose (11.3 Gy vs. 9.9 Gy) and a lower D(2cc) bladder dose (10.9 Gy vs. 14.7 Gy, both p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In cervical cancer treatment, the use of a 3D brachytherapy technique (MRI-guided with or without interstitial needles) showed a trend towards an increased local control and improved overall survival with reduced toxicity, compared to the conventional 2D brachytherapy technique. The use of interstitial needles allowed dose sculpting, resulting in delivery of higher doses to the HR-CTV, while reducing radiation doses to organs at risk, such as the bladder.},

  abstract = {The GYN GEC-ESTRO working group issued three parts of recommendations and highlighted the pivotal role of MRI for the successful implementation of 3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy (BT). The main advantage of MRI as an imaging modality is its superior soft tissue depiction quality. To exploit the full potential of MRI for the better ability of the radiation oncologist to make the appropriate choice for the BT application technique and to accurately define the target volumes and the organs at risk, certain MR imaging criteria have to be fulfilled. Technical requirements, patient preparation, as well as image acquisition protocols have to be tailored to the needs of 3D image-based BT. The present recommendation is focused on the general principles of MR imaging for 3D image-based BT. Methods and parameters have been developed and progressively validated from clinical experience from different institutions (IGR, Universities of Vienna, Leuven, Aarhus and Ljubljana) and successfully applied during expert meetings, contouring workshops, as well as within clinical and interobserver studies. It is useful to perform pelvic MRI scanning prior to radiotherapy ("Pre-RT-MRI examination") and at the time of BT ("BT MRI examination") with one MR imager. Both low and high-field imagers, as well as both open and close magnet configurations conform to the requirements of 3D image-based cervical cancer BT. Multiplanar (transversal, sagittal, coronal and oblique image orientation) T2-weighted images obtained with pelvic surface coils are considered as the golden standard for visualisation of the tumour and the critical organs. The use of complementary MRI sequences (e.g. contrast-enhanced T1-weighted or 3D isotropic MRI sequences) is optional. Patient preparation has to be adapted to the needs of BT intervention and MR imaging. It is recommended to visualise and interpret the MR images on dedicated DICOM-viewer workstations, which should also assist the contouring procedure. Choice of imaging parameters and BT equipment is made after taking into account aspects of interaction between imaging and applicator reconstruction, as well as those between imaging, geometry and dose calculation. In a prospective clinical context, to implement 3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy and to take advantage of its full potential, it is essential to successfully meet the MR imaging criteria described in the present recommendations of the GYN GEC-ESTRO working group.},

  abstract = {The concept of ridges has appeared numerous times in the image processing liter\- ature. Sometimes the term is used in an intuitive sense. Other times a concrete definition is provided. In almost all cases the concept is used for very specific ap\- plications. When analyzing images or data sets, it is very natural for a scientist to measure critical behavior by considering maxima or minima of the data. These critical points are relatively easy to compute. Numerical packages always provide support for root finding or optimization, whether it be through bisection, Newton's method, conjugate gradient method, or other standard methods. It has not been natural for scientists to consider critical behavior in a higher-order sense. The con\- cept of ridge as a manifold of critical points is a natural extension of the concept of local maximum as an isolated critical point. However, almost no attention has been given to formalizing the concept. There is a need for a formal development. There is a need for understanding the computation issues that arise in the imple\- mentations. The purpose of this book is to address both needs by providing a formal mathematical foundation and a computational framework for ridges. The intended audience for this book includes anyone interested in exploring the use\- fulness of ridges in data analysis.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside., 3D Slicer is a free open source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm, and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions., In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Image guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) using intracavitary applicators (IC) has led to a significant improvement of local control in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Further improvement has been obtained with combined intracavitary/interstitial (IC/IS) applicators. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the impact on local control and late morbidity of application of combined IS/IC brachytherapy in a large multicentre population. MATERIAL/METHODS: 610 patients with LACC from the retroEMBRACE study were included. Patients were divided into an IC group (N=310) and an IC/IS group (N=300). The IC/IS group was defined from the time point, when a centre performed IC/IS brachytherapy in more than 20\% of cases. RESULTS: With systematic usage of IC/IS the D90 of CTVHR increased from 83{$\pm$}14Gy to 92{$\pm$}13Gy (p{$<$}0.01). No difference in doses to organs at risk was found. The 3-year local control rate in patients having a CTVHR volume{$\geqslant$}30cm3 was 10\% higher (p=0.02) in the IC/IS group. No difference was found for CTVHR{$<$}30cm3 (p=0.50). No significant difference in late morbidity was found between the IC/IS group and IC group. CONCLUSION: Combined IC/IS brachytherapy improves the therapeutic ratio in LACC by enabling a tumour specific dose escalation resulting in significantly higher local control in large tumours without adding treatment related late morbidity.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Brachytherapy dose calculation is commonly performed using the Task Group-No 43 Report-Updated protocol (TG-43U1) formalism. Recently, a more accurate approach has been proposed that can handle tissue composition, tissue density, body shape, applicator geometry, and dose reporting either in media or water. Some model-based dose calculation algorithms are based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. This work presents a software platform capable of processing medical images and treatment plans, and preparing the required input data for MC simulations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The A Medical Image-based Graphical platfOrm-Brachytherapy module (AMIGOBrachy) is a user interface, coupled to the MCNP6 MC code, for absorbed dose calculations. The AMIGOBrachy was first validated in water for a high-dose-rate (192)Ir source. Next, dose distributions were validated in uniform phantoms consisting of different materials. Finally, dose distributions were obtained in patient geometries. Results were compared against a treatment planning system including a linear Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE) solver capable of handling nonwater heterogeneities. RESULTS: The TG-43U1 source parameters are in good agreement with literature with more than 90\% of anisotropy values within 1\%. No significant dependence on the tissue composition was observed comparing MC results against an LBTE solver. Clinical cases showed differences up to 25\%, when comparing MC results against TG-43U1. About 92\% of the voxels exhibited dose differences lower than 2\% when comparing MC results against an LBTE solver. CONCLUSION: The AMIGOBrachy can improve the accuracy of the TG-43U1 dose calculation by using a more accurate MC dose calculation algorithm. The AMIGOBrachy can be incorporated in clinical practice via a user-friendly graphical interface.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Registration of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images are commonly performed to define the different target regions used in radiotherapy treatment planning (RTTP). The accuracy of target definition will then depend on the spatial accuracy of the CT and MR data, and on the technique used to register the images. CT images are usually regarded as geometrically correct, while MR images are known to suffer from geometric distortion. The aim of this paper is to discuss the possible impact of MR image distortions in the radiotherapy treatment planning process. METHODS: The origin, magnitude, and relative impact of the different sources of geometric distortions that affect the MR image data at different magnetic fields and for different acquisition settings are described. Techniques for distortion correction are reviewed, and their limitations are outlined. The sensitivity of image registration techniques to the presence of geometric distortions in the MR data is discussed. Finally, an overview of image registration techniques used and results obtained in clinical radiotherapy treatment planning applications is given. RESULTS: Spatial distortions in MR images vary with field strength and with the image acquisition protocol. The spatial accuracy generally decreases with distance from the magnet isocenter. Distortion correction techniques based on phantom evaluations cannot adequately model patient-induced distortions. CONCLUSION: Image protocols with high gradient bandwidths should be used to reduce the spatial distortions in MR images. Correction techniques based only on phantom measurements could be sufficient at low magnetic fields, while at higher fields additional corrections of patient-related distortions might be needed. Registration techniques based on matching of Landmark points located far from the magnet isocenter are especially prone to MR distortions.},

The discrete objects can be measured (length, area) and can interact with other discrete objects (collision/response). From a computational standpoint, the discrete objects are attractive, because they have been designed from the ground up with data-structures and algorithms in mind. From a mathematical standpoint, they present a great challenge: the discrete objects should have properties which are analogues of the properties of continuous objects. One important property of curves and surfaces is their curvature, which plays a significant role in many application areas (see, e.g., Chapters 4 and 5). In the continuous domain there are remarkable theorems dealing with curvature; a key requirement for a discrete curve with discrete curvature is that it satisfies analogous theorems. In this chapter we examine the curvature of continuous and discrete curves on the plane.}

  abstract = {Purpose Segmentation of left ventricular myocardium (LVM) in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is important for diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Due to poor image contrast and large variation in intensity and shapes, LVM segmentation for CCTA is a challenging task. The purpose of this work is to develop a region-based deep learning method to automatically detect and segment the LVM solely based on CCTA images. Methods We developed a 3D deeply supervised U-Net, which incorporates attention gates (AGs) to focus on the myocardial boundary structures, to segment LVM contours from CCTA. The deep attention U-Net (DAU-Net) was trained on the patients' CCTA images, with a manual contour-derived binary mask used as the learning-based target. The network was supervised by a hybrid loss function, which combined logistic loss and Dice loss to simultaneously measure the similarities and discrepancies between the prediction and training datasets. To evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation, we retrospectively investigated 100 patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD). The LVM volume was segmented by the proposed method and compared with physician-approved clinical contours. Quantitative metrics used were Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), mean surface distance (MSD), residual mean square distance (RMSD), the center of mass distance (CMD), and volume difference (VOD). Results The proposed method created contours with very good agreement to the ground truth contours. Our proposed segmentation approach is benchmarked primarily using fivefold cross validation. Model prediction correlated and agreed well with manual contour. The mean DSC of the contours delineated by our method was 91.6\% among all patients. The resultant HD was 6.840 {$\pm$} 4.410 mm. The proposed method also resulted in a small CMD (1.058 {$\pm$} 1.245 mm) and VOD (1.640 {$\pm$} 1.777 cc). Among all patients, the MSD and RMSD were 0.433 {$\pm$} 0.209 mm and 0.724 {$\pm$} 0.375 mm, respectively, between ground truth and LVM volume resulting from the proposed method. Conclusions We developed a novel deep learning-based approach for the automated segmentation of the LVM on CCTA images. We demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed learning-based segmentation method through comparison with ground truth contour of 100 clinical patient cases using six quantitative metrics. These results show the potential of using automated LVM segmentation for computer-aided delineation of CADs in the clinical setting.},

Materials and methods Custom-made plastic catheters with a copper sulphate solution were made for insertion in the source channels of MR-CT compatible applicators: plastic and titanium tandem ring applicators, and titanium needles. The applicators were CT and MR scanned in a phantom for accurate 3D assessment of applicator visibility and geometry. A reconstruction method was developed and evaluated in 19 patient MR examinations with ring applicator (plastic: 14, titanium: 5). MR applicator reconstruction uncertainties related to inter-observer variation were evaluated. Results The catheters were visible in the plastic applicator on T1-weighted images in phantom and in 14/14 clinical applications. On T2-weighted images, the catheters appeared weaker but still visible in phantom and in 13/14 MR clinical applications. In the titanium applicator, the catheters could not be separated from the artifacts from the applicator itself. However, these artifacts could be used to localize both titanium ring applicator (5/5 clinical applications) and needles (6/6 clinical applications). Standard deviations of inter-observer differences were below 2\hspace{0.25em}mm in all directions. Conclusion 3D applicator reconstruction based on MR imaging could be performed for plastic and titanium applicators. Plastic applicators proved well to be suited for MRI-based reconstruction. For improved practicability of titanium applicator reconstruction, development of MR applicator markers is essential. Reconstruction of titanium applicator and needles at 1.5\hspace{0.25em}T MR requires geometric evaluations in phantoms before using the applicator in patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brachytherapy (BT) plays a crucial role in the management of invasive cervix cancer from stage I to IV. Intracavitary techniques are based on afterloading devices, with different types of applicators. CT and/or MRI compatible applicators allow a sectional image based approach with a better assessment of gross tumour volume (GTV) and definition and delineation of target volume (CTV) compared to traditional approaches. Accurate and reproducible delineation of GTV, CTV and PTV, as well as of critical organs has a direct impact on BT treatment planning, especially if it is possible to adapt the pear-shape isodose by optimisation using DVH analysis. When introducing a 3D image based approach for GTV and CTV assessment, there is a need for a common language to describe the concepts and to define the terms which are to be used. METHODS: In 2000, GEC-ESTRO decided to support 3D imaging based 3D treatment planning approach in cervix cancer BT with the creation of a Working Group. The task was to describe basic concepts and terms and to work out a terminology enabling various groups working in this advanced field to use a common language. The recommendations described in this report were proposed based on clinical experience and dosimetric concepts of different institutions (IGR, Leuven, Vienna) and were stepwise validated against the background of different clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: As GTV and CTV for BT change significantly during treatment, time frame for assessment of GTV and CTV for BT is specified in this report: at time of diagnosis GTV(D), CTV(D) and at time of BT GTV(B), CTV(B). Furthermore, CTV for BT is defined related to risk for recurrence: high risk CTV and intermediate risk CTV. Beside verbal descriptions detailed examples are given, partly in form of schematic drawings.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 7359 patients with stages IB2-IVA cervical cancer treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) between 1988 and 2009. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences between patients who received brachytherapy and those who did not from 2000 onward (after the National Cancer Institute alert recommending concurrent chemotherapy). RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of the 7359 women received brachytherapy in combination with EBRT, and 37\% received EBRT alone. The brachytherapy utilization rate has decreased from 83\% in 1988 to 58\% in 2009 (P{$<$}.001), with a sharp decline of 23\% in 2003 to 43\%. Factors associated with higher odds of brachytherapy use include younger age, married (vs single) patients, earlier years of diagnosis, earlier stage and certain SEER regions. In the propensity score-matched cohort, brachytherapy treatment was associated with higher 4-year cause-specific survival (CSS; 64.3\% vs 51.5\%, P{$<$}.001) and overall survival (OS; 58.2\% vs 46.2\%, P{$<$}.001). Brachytherapy treatment was independently associated with better CSS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.71), and OS (HR 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: This population-based analysis reveals a concerning decline in brachytherapy utilization and significant geographic disparities in the delivery of brachytherapy in the United States. Brachytherapy use is independently associated with significantly higher CSS and OS and should be implemented in all feasible cases.},

  abstract = {Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation. The popular "U-shaped" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021 segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing approaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr},

In FCNNs, the encoder plays an integral role by learning both global and local features and contextual representations which can be utilized for semantic output prediction by the decoder. Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. We introduce a novel architecture, dubbed as UNEt TRansformers (UNETR), that utilizes a transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume and effectively capture the global multi-scale information, while also following the successful "U-shaped" network design for the encoder and decoder. The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via skip connections at different resolutions to compute the final semantic segmentation output. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for multi-organ segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks.

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance.

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of heterogeneity-corrected dose calculation on dosimetric quality parameters in gynecological and breast brachytherapy using Acuros, a grid-based Boltzmann equation solver (GBBS), and to evaluate the shielding effects of different cervix brachytherapy applicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Calculations with TG-43 and Acuros were based on computed tomography (CT) retrospectively, for 10 cases of accelerated partial breast irradiation and 9 cervix cancer cases treated with tandem-ring applicators. Phantom CT-scans of different applicators (plastic and titanium) were acquired. For breast cases the V20Gy{$\alpha\beta$}3 to lung, the D0.1cm(3) , D1cm(3) , D2cm(3) to rib, the D0.1cm(3) , D1cm(3) , D10cm(3) to skin, and Dmax for all structures were reported. For cervix cases, the D0.1cm(3) , D2cm(3) to bladder, rectum and sigmoid, and the D50, D90, D98, V100 for the CTVHR were reported. For the phantom study, surrogates for target and organ at risk were created for a similar dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis. Absorbed dose and equivalent dose to 2 Gy fractionation (EQD2) were used for comparison. RESULTS: Calculations with TG-43 overestimated the dose for all dosimetric indices investigated. For breast, a decrease of \textasciitilde 8\% was found for D10cm(3) to the skin and 5\% for D2cm(3) to rib, resulting in a difference \textasciitilde{} -1.5 Gy EQD2 for overall treatment. Smaller effects were found for cervix cases with the plastic applicator, with up to -2\% (-0.2 Gy EQD2) per fraction for organs at risk and -0.5\% (-0.3 Gy EQD2) per fraction for CTVHR. The shielding effect of the titanium applicator resulted in a decrease of 2\% for D2cm(3) to the organ at risk versus 0.7\% for plastic. CONCLUSIONS: Lower doses were reported when calculating with Acuros compared to TG-43. Differences in dose parameters were larger in breast cases. A lower impact on clinical dose parameters was found for the cervix cases. Applicator material causes systematic shielding effects that can be taken into account.},

A decline in brachytherapy has been associated with negative impacts on survival in the era of modern EBRT techniques. Conformal external beam therapies such intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) should not be used as alternatives to brachytherapy in patients undergoing primary curative-intent radiation therapy for cervical cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval and informed consent for evaluation of preoperative CT (n = 146) and/or MR imaging (n = 152) studies in 156 women (median age, 43 years; range, 22-81 years) from a previous prospective multicenter American College of Radiology Imaging Network and Gynecologic Oncology Group study of 172 women with biopsy-proved cervical cancer (clinical stage {$>$} or = IB). Four radiologists (experience, 7-15 years) interpreted the CT scans, and four radiologists (experience, 12-20 years) interpreted the MR studies retrospectively. Tumor visualization and detection of parametrial invasion were assessed with receiver operating characteristic curves (with P {$<$} or = .05 considered to indicate a significant difference). Descriptive statistics for staging and kappa statistics for reader agreement were calculated. Surgical pathologic findings were the reference standard. RESULTS: For CT and MR imaging, respectively, multirater kappa values were 0.26 and 0.44 for staging, 0.16 and 0.32 for tumor visualization, and -0.04 and 0.11 for detection of parametrial invasion; for advanced stage cancer ({$>$} or =IIB), sensitivities were 0.14-0.38 and 0.40-0.57, positive predictive values (PPVs) were 0.38-1.00 and 0.32-0.39, specificities were 0.84-1.00 and 0.77-0.80, and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 0.81-0.84 and 0.83-0.87. MR imaging was significantly better than CT for tumor visualization (P {$<$} .001) and detection of parametrial invasion (P = .047). CONCLUSION: Reader agreement was higher for MR imaging than for CT but was low for both. MR imaging was significantly better than CT for tumor visualization and detection of parametrial invasion. The modalities were similar for staging, sharing low sensitivity and PPV but relatively high NPV and specificity.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop and evaluate a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) machine parameter optimization (MPO) approach based on deep-Q reinforcement learning (RL) capable of finding an optimal machine control policy using previous prostate cancer patient CT scans and contours, and applying the policy to new cases to rapidly produce deliverable VMAT plans in a simplified beam model. Methods A convolutional deep-Q network was employed to control the dose rate and multileaf collimator of a C-arm linear accelerator model using the current dose distribution and machine parameter state as input. A Q-value was defined as the discounted cumulative cost based on dose objectives, and experience-replay RL was performed to determine a policy to minimize the Q-value. A two-dimensional network design was employed which optimized each opposing leaf pair independently while monitoring the corresponding dose plane blocked by those leaves. This RL approach was applied to CT and contours from 40 retrospective prostate cancer patients. The dataset was split into training (15 patients) and validation (5 patients) groups to optimize the network, and its performance was tested in an independent cohort of 20 patients by comparing RL-based dose distributions to conformal arcs and clinical intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivering a prescription dose of 78 Gy in 40 fractions. Results Mean {$\pm$} SD execution time of the RL VMAT optimization was 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 s per slice. In the test cohort, mean {$\pm$} SD (P-value) planning target volume (PTV), bladder, and rectum dose were 80.5 {$\pm$} 2.0 Gy (P {$<$} 0.001), 44.2 {$\pm$} 14.6 Gy (P {$<$} 0.001), and 43.7 {$\pm$} 11.1 Gy (P {$<$} 0.001) for RL VMAT compared to 81.6 {$\pm$} 1.1 Gy, 51.6 {$\pm$} 12.9 Gy, and 36.0 {$\pm$} 12.3 Gy for clinical IMRT. Conclusions RL was applied to VMAT MPO using clinical patient contours without independently optimized treatment plans for training and achieved comparable target and normal tissue dose to clinical plans despite the application of a relatively simple network design originally developed for video-game control. These results suggest that extending a RL approach to a full three-dimensional beam model could enable rapid artificial intelligence-based optimization of deliverable treatment plans, reducing the time required for radiotherapy planning without requiring previous plans for training.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The MRI-guided cervical cancer brachytherapy provides unparalleled soft-tissue contrast for target and normal tissue contouring, but eliminates the ability to use conventional metallic fiducials for radiation source path reconstruction as required for treatment planning. Instead, the source path is reconstructed by manually aligning a library model to the signal void produced by the applicator, which takes time intraoperatively and precludes fully automated treatment planning. The purpose of this study is to present and validate an algorithm to automatically reconstruct tandem and ring applicators using MRI for cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. METHODS: Applicators were reconstructed using T2-weighted MR images acquired at 1.5 T from 33 brachytherapy fractions including 10 patients using a model-to-image registration algorithm. The algorithm involves (a) image filtering and maximum intensity projection to highlight the applicator, (b) ring center identification using the circular Hough transform, and (c) three-dimensional surface model registration, optimized by maximizing the image intensity gradient normal to the model surface. Two independent observers manually reconstructed all applicators, enabling the calculation of interobserver variability and establishing a ground truth. Algorithm variability was calculated by comparing algorithm results to each individual observer, and algorithm accuracy was calculated by comparing algorithm results to the ground truth. The algorithm variability and accuracy were compared to the interobserver variability using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Mean {$\pm$} SD interobserver variability was 0.83 {$\pm$} 0.31 mm and 0.78 {$\pm$} 0.29 mm for the ring and tandem, respectively. The algorithm had mean {$\pm$} SD variability and accuracy of 0.72 {$\pm$} 0.32 mm (P = 0.02) and 0.60 {$\pm$} 0.24 mm (P = 0.0005) for the ring, and 0.70 {$\pm$} 0.29 mm (P = 0.11) and 0.58 {$\pm$} 0.24 mm (P = 0.004) for the tandem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm variability and accuracy were within the interobserver variability measured in this study. The algorithm accuracy and mean execution time of 10.0 s are sufficient for clinical tandem and ring reconstruction, and are a step toward fully automated tandem and ring brachytherapy treatment planning.},

Material and methods: U-Net model was developed for applicator segmentation in CT images. Sixty cervical cancer patients with Fletcher applicator were divided into training data and validation data according to ratio of 50 : 10, and another 10 patients with Fletcher applicator were employed to test the model. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) were used to evaluate the model. Segmented applicator coordinates were calculated and applied into RT structure file. Tip error and shaft error of applicators were evaluated. Dosimetric differences between manual reconstruction and deep learning-based reconstruction were compared. Results: The averaged overall 10 test patients' DSC, HD95, and reconstruction time were 0.89, 1.66 mm, and 17.12 s, respectively. The average tip error was 0.80 mm, and the average shaft error was less than 0.50 mm. The dosimetric differences between manual reconstruction and automatic reconstruction were 0.29\% for high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) D90\%, and less than 2.64\% for organs at risk D2cc at a scenario of doubled maximum shaft error. Conclusions: We proposed a deep learning-based reconstruction method to localize Fletcher applicator in three-dimensional CT images. The achieved accuracy and efficiency confirmed our method as clinically attractive. It paves the way for the automation of brachytherapy treatment planning.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the dosimetric impact of heterogeneity corrections on both conventional and volume-optimized high-dose-rate (HDR) {$^{192}$}Ir brachytherapy tandem-and-ovoid treatment plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Both conventional and volume-optimized treatment plans were retrospectively created using eight unique CT data sets. In the volume-optimized plans, the clinical target volume (CTV) and organs-at-risk (rectum, bladder, and sigmoid) were contoured on the CT data sets by a single physician. For each plan, dose calculations representing homogeneous water medium were performed using the Task Group (TG-43) formalism and dose calculations with heterogeneity corrections were performed using a commercially available treatment planning system. RESULTS: For the conventional plans, the change in dose between TG-43 and heterogeneity-corrected calculations was assessed for the following points: Point-A (left and right) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) 38 defined rectum and bladder points. It was found that the dose to the ICRU bladder decreased the most (-2.2{$\pm$}0.9\%), whereas ICRU rectum (-1.7{$\pm$}0.8\%), Point-A right (-1.1{$\pm$}0.4\%), and Point-A left (-1.0{$\pm$}0.3\%) also showed decreases with heterogeneity-corrected calculations. For the volume-optimized plans, the change in dose between TG-43 and heterogeneity-corrected calculations was assessed for the following dose-volume histogram parameters: D(90) of the CTV and D(2cc) of the rectum, bladder, and sigmoid. It was found that D(90) of the CTV decreased by -1.9{$\pm$}0.7\% and D(2cc) decreased by -2.6{$\pm$}1.4\%, -1.0{$\pm$}0.4\%, and -2.0{$\pm$}0.6\% for the rectum, bladder and sigmoid, respectively, with heterogeneity-corrected calculations. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity corrections on high-dose rate plans were found to have only a small dosimetric impact over TG-43-based dose calculations for both conventional Point-A and volume-optimized plans.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients treated with EMBRACE protocol were analyzed. Every patient had two applications, one week apart. For each application patient had undergone MR-imaging (MR-1 and MR-2), volume delineation, reconstruction, treatment planning (plan-1 and plan-2) and dose evaluation. Both the image series were then co-registered with applicator as the reference coordinate system (Eclipse planning system v8.6.14). Inter-application dose, volume and spatial location of D(2cm(3)) variation were evaluated. RESULTS: The largest inter-application systematic and random dose variations were observed for sigmoid as compared to rectum and bladder. The mean ({$\pm$}SD) of the relative D(2cm(3)) variations were 0.6({$\pm$}15.1)\%, 0.9({$\pm$}13.1)\% and 11.9({$\pm$}37.5)\% for rectum, bladder and sigmoid respectively. The overlap of D(2cm(3)) volumes was more than 50\% in 16(59\%), 8(30\%) and 3(11\%) patients for rectum, bladder and sigmoid, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 2cm(3) volumes between the applications/fractions are quite stable in topography for bladder and rectum, and hence the current practice of cumulative addition of D(2cm(3)) dose is expected to be valid for bladder and rectum. For sigmoid, significant topographical changes were seen, which need further validation in a larger patient population and in multi-centric settings.},

METHODS: CT simulation scans from 10 medically inoperable early stage endometrial cancer patients previously treated with high dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy were used to generate Helical Tomotherapy (HT) plans using the IMRT mode with clinical target volumes (CTVs) that included the uterus plus cervix. A prescription dose of 34 Gy in 4 fractions was used. The SBRT dosimetry was compared to the 10 prior intracavitary brachytherapy plans normalized to a standard dose. Organs at risk (OARs) evaluated were the bladder, rectum, sigmoid, femoral heads, and other bowel, including both large and small bowel. The simulation CT and daily image guidance for 4 patients treated with this technique were evaluated to assess for interfraction variation in the uterine position and effects on dosimetry. RESULTS: Compared to intracavitary brachytherapy, HT SBRT produced significantly greater overall target coverage to the uterus, boost CTV, and PTV, with exception of the V150\% of the uterus. HT SBRT significantly increased dose to the rectum, bowel, and femoral heads compared to intracavitary brachytherapy, though not outside of dose tolerance limits. Review of daily image guidance for patients treated with this technique demonstrated good reproducibility with a mean overlap index of 0.87 (range, 0.74 - 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Definitive SBRT for medically inoperable early stage endometrial cancer appears to be a feasible treatment option. Future studies are warranted to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes with this technique, compared to HDR intracavitary brachytherapy.},

We considered the Mi test to be a reliable method for demonstrating the existence of suppressor cells induced by the injection of live BCG. Moreover, we found that the adherent cells of PEC possessed a suppressive effect which was retained even after treatment with either anti-mouse Ig or anti-brain associated theta (BA theta) antigen; that the PEC from mice injected with live BCG on at least the 12th day before cell harvesting showed the suppression; and that the suppression operated across the H-2 barrier.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Retrospective analysis of patients with invasive endometrial neoplasia who were treated with external beam radiation therapy followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) boost because of the inability to undergo surgery or brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 11 women with stage I-III endometrial cancer with a median age of 78 years that were not candidates for hysterectomy or intracavitary brachytherapy secondary to comorbidities (91\%) or refusal (9\%). Eight patients were American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I (3 stage IA, 5 stage IB), and 3 patients were AJCC stage III. Patients were treated to a median of 4500 cGy at 180 cGy per fraction followed by SBRT boost (600 cGy per fraction\texttimes 5). RESULTS: The most common side effect was acute grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity in 73\% of patients, with no late toxicities observed. With a median follow-up of 10 months since SBRT, 5 patients (45\%) experienced locoregional disease progression, with 3 patients (27\%) succumbing to their malignancy. At 12 and 18 months from SBRT, the overall freedom from progression was 68\% and 41\%, respectively. Overall freedom from progression (FFP) was 100\% for all patients with AJCC stage IA endometrial carcinoma, whereas it was 33\% for stage IB at 18 months. The overall FFP was 100\% for International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology grade 1 disease. The estimated overall survival was 57\% at 18 months from diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In this study, SBRT boost to the intact uterus was feasible, with encouragingly low rates of acute and late toxicity, and favorable disease control in patients with early-stage disease. Additional studies are needed to provide better insight into the best management of these clinically challenging cases.},

They are used at all stages of the patient management process; for initial diagnosis and staging, during treatment planning and delivery, and after therapy to help monitor the patients' response to treatment. Most treatment planning systems now support some form of interactive or automated image registration and provide tools for mapping information, such as tissue outlines and computed dose from one imaging study to another. To complement this, modern treatment delivery systems offer means for acquiring and registering 2D and 3D image data at the treatment unit to aid patient setup. Techniques for adapting and customizing treatments during the course of therapy using 3D and 4D anatomic and functional imaging data are currently being introduced into the clinic. These techniques require sophisticated image registration and data fusion technology to accumulate properly the delivered dose and to analyse possible physiological and anatomical changes during treatment. Finally, the correlation of radiological changes after therapy with delivered dose also requires the use of image registration and fusion techniques.},

The efficiency of needle-based interventions depends on accurate control of the needle tip. This paper presents a comprehensive mechanics-based model for simulation of planar needle insertion in soft tissue. The proposed model for needle deflection is based on beam theory, works in real-time, and accepts the insertion velocity as an input that can later be used as a control command for needle steering. The model takes into account the effects of tissue deformation, needle-tissue friction, tissue cutting force, and needle bevel angle on needle deflection. Using a robot that inserts a flexible needle into a phantom tissue, various experiments are conducted to separately identify different subsets of the model parameters. The validity of the proposed model is verified by comparing the simulation results to the empirical data. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting the needle tip deflection for different insertion velocities.},

  abstract = {Definitive, nonsurgical management of gynecologic malignancies involves external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and/or brachytherapy (BT). Summation of the cumulative dose is critical to assess the total biologic effective dose to targets and organs at risk. Cumulative dose calculation from EBRT and BT can be performed with or without image registration (IR) and biologic dose summation. Among these dose summation strategies, linear addition of dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters without IR is the global standard for composite dose reporting. This approach stems from an era without image guidance and simple external beam and brachytherapy treatment approaches. With technological advances, EBRT and high-dose-rate BT have evolved to allow for volume-based treatment planning and delivery. Modern conformal therapeutic radiation involves volumetric or intensity modulated EBRT, capable of simultaneously treating multiple targets at different specified dose levels. Therefore, given the complexity of modern radiation treatment, the linear addition of DVH parameters from EBRT and high-dose-rate BT is challenging to represent the combined dose distribution. Deformable image registration (DIR) between EBRT and image guided brachytherapy (IGBT) data sets may provide a more nuanced calculation of multimodal dose accumulation. However, DIR is still nascent in this regard, and needs further development for accuracy and efficiency for clinical use. Biologic dose summation can combine physical dose maps from EBRT and each IGBT fraction, thereby generating a composite DVH from the biologic effective dose. However, accurate radiobiologic parameters are tissue-dependent and not well characterized. A combination of voxel-based DIR and biologic weighted dose maps may be the best approximation of dose accumulation but remains invalidated. The purpose of this report is to review dose summation strategies for EBRT and BT, including conventional equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions dose summation without image registration, physical dose summation using 3-dimensional rigid IR and DIR, and biologic dose summation. We also provide general clinical workflows for IGBT with a focus on cervical cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To qualitatively and quantitatively analyze needle visibility in combined intracavitary and interstitial cervical cancer brachytherapy on 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in comparison to gold standard MRI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Image acquisition was done with a customized TRUS stepper unit and software (Medcom, Germany; Elekta, Sweden; ACMIT, Austria) followed by an MRI on the same day with the applicator in place. Qualitative assessment was done with following scoring system: 0\,=\,no visibility 1 (= poor), 2 (= fair), 3 (= excellent) discrimination, quantitative assessment was done by measuring the distance between each needle and the tandem two centimeters (cm) above the ring and comparing to the respective measurement on MRI. RESULTS: Twenty-nine implants and a total of 188 needles (132 straight, 35 oblique, 21 free-hand) were available. Overall, 79\% were visible (87\% straight, 51\% oblique, 76\% free-hand). Mean visibility score was 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.5 for all visible needles. Distance of the visible needles to tandem was mean {$\pm$} standard deviation (SD) 21.3 millimeters (mm) {$\pm$} 6.5 mm on MRI and 21.0 mm {$\pm$} 6.4 mm on TRUS, respectively. Difference between MRI and TRUS was max 14 mm, mean {$\pm$} SD -0.3 mm {$\pm$} 2.6 mm. 11\% differed more than 3 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Straight needles were better detectable than oblique needles (87\% vs. 51\%). Detectability was impaired by insufficient rotation of the TRUS probe, poor image quality or anatomic variation. As needles show a rather indistinct signal on TRUS, online detection with a standardized imaging protocol in combination with tracking should be investigated, aiming at the development of real time image guidance and online treatment planning.},

  abstract = {``Radiomics'' refers to the extraction and analysis of large amounts of advanced quantitative imaging features with high throughput from medical images obtained with computed tomography, positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Importantly, these data are designed to be extracted from standard-of-care images, leading to a very large potential subject pool. Radiomics data are in a mineable form that can be used to build descriptive and predictive models relating image features to phenotypes or gene\textendash protein signatures. The core hypothesis of radiomics is that these models, which can include biological or medical data, can provide valuable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information. The radiomics enterprise can be divided into distinct processes, each with its own challenges that need to be overcome: (a) image acquisition and reconstruction, (b) image segmentation and rendering, (c) feature extraction and feature qualification and (d) databases and data sharing for eventual (e) ad hoc informatics analyses. Each of these individual processes poses unique challenges. For example, optimum protocols for image acquisition and reconstruction have to be identified and harmonized. Also, segmentations have to be robust and involve minimal operator input. Features have to be generated that robustly reflect the complexity of the individual volumes, but cannot be overly complex or redundant. Furthermore, informatics databases that allow incorporation of image features and image annotations, along with medical and genetic data, have to be generated. Finally, the statistical approaches to analyze these data have to be optimized, as radiomics is not a mature field of study. Each of these processes will be discussed in turn, as well as some of their unique challenges and proposed approaches to solve them. The focus of this article will be on images of non-small-cell lung cancer.},

In addition, a survey of patients treated in 1973 from selected large facilities was conducted to establish outcome with "optimal" radiotherapy. The large facility survey consistently reported improved outcome compared to both national average surveys when analyzed by stage and other significant pretreatment factors. That improved outcome was associated with the paracentral (PCS point A) dose and the use of intracavitary irradiation. In this study, we report the pretreatment and treatment factors associated with improved outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix by analysis of the 1973 and 1978 PCS data. Pretreatment factors associated with improved pelvic control in multivariate analysis include higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (Stage I and II), older age (Stage I and II), unilateral parametrial involvement (Stage IIB), and unilateral sidewall involvement (Stage III). The only treatment factor associated with improved pelvic control in multivariate analysis is the use of intracavitary irradiation. However, a dose response for infield pelvic control was demonstrated only in Stage III cervix cancer with the highest rate of pelvic control with paracentral (PCS point A) dose greater than 8500 cGy. Multivariate analysis revealed that unilateral parametrial involvement for Stage IIB and unilateral sidewall involvement for Stage III are significant positive prognostic factors with respect to survival after treatment with radiotherapy. No FIGO substage significantly affected survival after radiotherapy. Although FIGO staging is the single most important pretreatment prognostic factor with respect to survival and infield pelvic failure, FIGO substaging deserves reappraisal and further refinement. Major complications were seen in only 9.5\% of patients treated with radiotherapy and were stage but not survey related. There is a significant relationship between PCS point A dose and complications with the highest rate of complications for PCS point A dose greater than 8500 cGy. A significant relationship between lateral (external iliac lymph nodes or PCS point P) dose and major complications is also found, and doses greater than 5000 cGy are associated with a significant increase in complications. The PCS has established two sequential national benchmarks of treatment outcome for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with radiotherapy with respect to survival, infield pelvic control, and complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Permanent interstitial brachytherapy is an effective, minimally invasive, and patient friendly cancer treatment procedure. The deflection of the needles used in the procedure, however, undermines the treatment efficiency and, therefore, needs to be minimized. Any feedback control technique to minimize the needle deflection will require feedback of this quantity, which is not easy to provide. The proposed virtual sensor for needle deflection incorporates a force/torque sensor, mounted at the base of the needle that always remains outside the patient. The measured forces/torques are used by a mathematical model, developed based on mechanical needle properties. The resulting estimation of tip deflection in real time during needle insertion is the main contribution of this paper. The proposed approach solely relies on the measured forces and torques without a need for any other invasive/noninvasive sensing devices. A few mechanical models have been introduced previously regarding the way the forces are composed along the needle during insertion; we will compare our model to those approaches in terms of accuracy. In order to conduct experiments to verify the deflection model, a custom-built, 2-DOF robotic system for needle insertion is developed and discussed. This system is a prototype of an intelligent, hand-held surgical assistant tool that incorporates the virtual sensor proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: High-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy involves treatment catheter placement, which is currently empirical and physician dependent. The lack of proper catheter placement guidance during the procedure has left the physicians to rely on a heuristic thinking-while-doing technique, which may cause large catheter placement variation and increased plan quality uncertainty. Therefore, the achievable dose distribution could not be quantified prior to the catheter placement. To overcome this challenge, we proposed a learning-based method to provide HDR catheter placement guidance for prostate cancer patients undergoing HDR brachytherapy. METHODS: The proposed framework consists of deformable registration via registration network (Reg-Net), multi-atlas ranking, and catheter regression. To model the global spatial relationship among multiple organs, binary masks of the prostate and organs-at-risk are transformed into distance maps, which describe the distance of each local voxel to the organ surfaces. For a new patient, the generated distance map is used as fixed image. Reg-Net is utilized to deformably register the distance maps from multi-atlas set to match this patient's distance map and then bring catheter maps from multi-atlas to this patient via spatial transformation. Several criteria, namely prostate volume similarity, multi-organ semantic image similarity, and catheter position criteria (far from the urethra and within the partial prostate), are used for multi-atlas ranking. The top-ranked atlas' deformed catheter positions are selected as the predicted catheter positions for this patient. Finally, catheter regression is used to refine the final catheter positions. A retrospective study on 90 patients with a fivefold cross-validation scheme was used to evaluate the proposed method's feasibility. In order to investigate the impact of plan quality from the predicted catheter pattern, we optimized the source dwell position and time for both the clinical catheter pattern and predicted catheter pattern with the same optimization settings. Comparisons of clinically relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were completed. RESULTS: For all patients, on average, both the clinical plan dose and predicted plan dose meet the common dose constraints when prostate dose coverage is kept at V100 = 95\%. The plans from the predicted catheter pattern have slightly higher hotspot in terms of V150 by 5.0\% and V200 by 2.9\% on average. For bladder V75, rectum V75, and urethra V125, the average difference is close to zero, and the range of most patients is within {$\pm$}1 cc. CONCLUSION: We developed a new catheter placement prediction method for HDR prostate brachytherapy based on a deep-learning-based multi-atlas registration algorithm. It has great clinical potential since it can provide catheter location estimation prior to catheter placement, which could reduce the dependence on physicians' experience in catheter implantation and improve the quality of prostate HDR treatment plans. This approach merits further clinical evaluation and validation as a method of quality control for HDR prostate brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To define patient, tumor, and treatment factors that influence the outcome of patients with FIGO Stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the intact uterine cervix. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 1,096 patients treated with radiation therapy between 1960 and 1993 for FIGO Stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the intact uterine cervix were reviewed retrospectively. Of these, 983 (90\%) were treated with curative intent and 113 were treated only to achieve palliation of symptoms. Of 907 patients who completed the intended curative treatment, 641 (71\%) were treated with a combination of external beam irradiation (EBRT) and intracavitary irradiation (ICRT) and 266 (29\%) were treated with EBRT only. The median duration of treatment for these 907 patients was 51 days. Between 1966 and 1980, only 52\% of patients who completed treatment with curative intent received ICRT, compared with 92\% of patients treated during 1981-1993, an increase that reflects an evolution in the philosophy of treatment for advanced tumors. In general, the intensity of ICRT correlated inversely with the dose of EBRT to the,central pelvis. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 134 months. RESULTS: For 983 patients treated with initial curative intent, disease-specific survival (DSS) was significantly worse for those who were {$<$} 40 years old, had experienced more than a 10\% weight loss, or had a hemoglobin level {$<$} 10 g/dl before or during radiation therapy. Tumor factors that correlated with a relatively poor DSS were bilateral pelvic wall involvement, clinical tumor diameter {$>$} or = 8 cm, hydronephrosis, lower vaginal involvement, and evidence of lymph node metastases on lymphangiogram (p {$<$} 0.01 in all cases). For the 907 patients who completed treatment with curative intent, 641 who had ICRT had a DSS of 45\% at 5 years, compared with 24\% for those treated with EBRT alone (p {$<$} 0.0001). Those who received {$>$} 52 Gy of EBRT to the central pelvis had DSS rates of 27-34\%, compared with 53\% for patients treated with lower doses of EBRT to the central pelvis and more intensive ICRT (p {$<$} 0.0001). At 5 years, the actuarial risk of major complications was also greater for patients treated with {$>$} 52 Gy of EBRT to the central pelvis (57-68\%), compared with those who had 48-52 Gy (28\%) and those who had {$<$} or = 47 Gy of EBRT to the central pelvis (15\%) (p {$<$} 0.0001). Outcome was also compared for four time periods during which different treatment policies were in place for patients with Stage IIIB disease. The highest DSS (51\%) and lowest actuarial complication rate (17\%) were achieved during the most recent period (1981-1993) when modest doses of EBRT were combined with relatively intensive ICRT (p {$<$} 0.01 for both comparisons). CONCLUSION: Aggressive use of ICRT, carefully balanced with pelvic EBRT, is necessary to achieve the best ratio between tumor control and complications for patients with FIGO Stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix. In our experience, the highest DSS rates and the lowest complication rates were achieved with a combination of 40-45 Gy of EBRT combined with ICRT.},

  abstract = {Objectives Because radiotherapy is indispensible for treating cervical cancer, it is critical to accurately and efficiently delineate the radiation targets. We evaluated a deep learning (DL)-based auto-segmentation algorithm for automatic contouring of clinical target volumes (CTVs) in cervical cancers. Methods Computed tomography (CT) datasets from 535 cervical cancers treated with definitive or postoperative radiotherapy were collected. A DL tool based on VB-Net was developed to delineate CTVs of the pelvic lymph drainage area (dCTV1) and parametrial area (dCTV2) in the definitive radiotherapy group. The training/validation/test number is 157/20/23. CTV of the pelvic lymph drainage area (pCTV1) was delineated in the postoperative radiotherapy group. The training/validation/test number is 272/30/33. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to evaluate the contouring accuracy. Contouring times were recorded for efficiency comparison. Results The mean DSC, MSD, and HD values for our DL-based tool were 0.88/1.32 mm/21.60 mm for dCTV1, 0.70/2.42 mm/22.44 mm for dCTV2, and 0.86/1.15 mm/20.78 mm for pCTV1. Only minor modifications were needed for 63.5\% of auto-segmentations to meet the clinical requirements. The contouring accuracy of the DL-based tool was comparable to that of senior radiation oncologists and was superior to that of junior/intermediate radiation oncologists. Additionally, DL assistance improved the performance of junior radiation oncologists for dCTV2 and pCTV1 contouring (mean DSC increases: 0.20 for dCTV2, 0.03 for pCTV1; mean contouring time decrease: 9.8 min for dCTV2, 28.9 min for pCTV1). Conclusions DL-based auto-segmentation improves CTV contouring accuracy, reduces contouring time, and improves clinical efficiency for treating cervical cancer.},

  abstract = {Recently, transperineal interstitial-intracavitary applicators have been used to treat locally limited and advanced perineal and gynecologic malignancies. We have developed a single afterloading applicator, referred to as the "MUPIT" (Martinez Universal Perineal Interstitial Template), which with its prototypes has been utilized to treat 78 patients with malignancies of the cervix, vagina, female urethra, perineum, prostate, and anorectal region. The device basically consists of two acrylic cylinders, an acrylic template with a predrilled array of holes that serve as guides for trocars, and a cover plate. Some of the guide holes on the template are angled outward to permit a wide lateral coverage without danger of striking the ischium. The cylinders have an axial hole large enough to pass a central tandem or a suction tube for the drainage of secretions. Thus, the device allows for the interstitial placement of 192Ir ribbons as well as the intracavitary placement of either 137Cs tubes or 192Ir ribbons. In use, the cylinders are placed in the vagina and rectum and then fastened to the template, so that a fixed geometric relationship among the tumor volume, normal structures, and source placement is preserved throughout the course of the implantation. Hollow, closed-end, stainless steel trocars are then inserted through the guide holes that produce optimal coverage of the treatment volume. Appropriate computer programs also have been developed on a minicomputer for the corresponding dose-rate computations. These programs run with sufficient speed that they may be used for both the planning of the source placement beforehand and the computation of the actual dose-rate distribution obtained. The advantages of the system are (1) greater control of the placement of sources relative to the tumor volume and critical structures owing to the fixed geometry provided by the template and cylinders, and (2) improved dose-rate distributions obtained by means of computer-assisted optimization of the source placement and strength during the planning phase.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the intrafractional movements of organs at risk (OARs) and their dosimetric impact during the delivery of pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy in cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An MRI on Day 1 was used for treatment planning in 19 patients. CT scans were acquired at Days 1, 2, and 3 with delineation of the OARs. The MRI plan was transferred to each CT. The intersection volume between the 10 Gy isodose and the OARs were monitored, reflecting movement. Lower dose evaluated in the maximally exposed 0.1 cm(3) of an organ and lower dose evaluated in the maximally exposed 2 cm(3) of an organ (D(2cm3)) were evaluated on each CT and compared. Results were averaged considering that each CT reflected one-third of the treatment course to evaluate the delivered dose. RESULTS: No major movements of the sigmoid and bladder were observed, whereas the rectum got significantly closer to the implant at Day 2. The consequence was an increase of 6\% {$\pm$} 5.3 (3.7 Gy, {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} = 3 Gy) of the delivered D(2cm3) from the planned dose, in contrast to 0.2\% {$\pm$} 6.1 for the bladder and 1.1\% {$\pm$} 6.4 for the sigmoid. The increase of the D(2cm3) of the rectum was reported in 17 patients, ranging from 0.4 to 9.4 Gy, leading to a 10.5\% overcoming of the dose constraint (75 Gy). Similar tendencies were reported for lower dose evaluated in the maximally exposed 0.1 cm(3) of an organ. CONCLUSIONS: A significant systematic variation was observed for the rectum (+3.7 Gy). As significant random variations were observed, caution should be exercised when the planned D(2cm3) is close to the dose constraints.},

This paper reports a system for fast automatic needle tip and trajectory localization and visualization in MRI that has been developed and tested in the context of an active clinical research program in prostate biopsy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported system for this clinical application and also the first reported system that leverages deep neural networks for segmentation and localization of needles in MRI across biomedical applications. Needle tip and trajectory were annotated on 583 T2-weighted intra-procedural MRI scans acquired after needle insertion for 71 patients who underwent transperineal MRI-targeted biopsy procedure at our institution. The images were divided into two independent training-validation and test sets at the patient level. A deep 3-D fully convolutional neural network model was developed, trained, and deployed on these samples. The accuracy of the proposed method, as tested on previously unseen data, was 2.80-mm average in needle tip detection and 0.98\textdegree{} in needle trajectory angle. An observer study was designed in which independent annotations by a second observer, blinded to the original observer, were compared with the output of the proposed method. The resultant error was comparable to the measured inter-observer concordance, reinforcing the clinical acceptability of the proposed method. The proposed system has the potential for deployment in clinical routine.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to commission a gynecologic shielded colpostat analytic model provided from a treatment planning system (TPS) library. We have reported retrospectively the dosimetric impact of this applicator model in a cohort of patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A commercial TPS with a grid-based Boltzmann solver (GBBS) was commissioned for (192)Ir high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer with stainless steel-shielded colpostats. Verification of the colpostat analytic model was verified using a radiograph and vendor schematics. MCNPX v2.6 Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare dose distributions around the applicator in water with the TPS GBBS dose predictions. Retrospectively, the dosimetric impact was assessed over 24 cervical cancer patients' HDR plans. RESULTS: Applicator (TPS ID \#AL13122005) shield dimensions were within 0.4 mm of the independent shield dimensions verification. GBBS profiles in planes bisecting the cap around the applicator agreed with Monte Carlo simulations within 2\% at most locations; differing screw representations resulted in differences of up to 9\%. For the retrospective study, the GBBS doses differed from TG-43 as follows (mean value {$\pm$} standard deviation [min, max]): International Commission on Radiation units [ICRU]rectum (-8.4 {$\pm$} 2.5\% [-14.1, -4.1\%]), ICRUbladder (-7.2 {$\pm$} 3.6\% [-15.7, -2.1\%]), D2cc-rectum (-6.2 {$\pm$} 2.6\% [-11.9, -0.8\%]), D2cc-sigmoid (-5.6 {$\pm$} 2.6\% [-9.3, -2.0\%]), and D2cc-bladder (-3.4 {$\pm$} 1.9\% [-7.2, -1.1\%]). CONCLUSIONS: As brachytherapy TPSs implement advanced model-based dose calculations, the analytic applicator models stored in TPSs should be independently validated before clinical use. For this cohort, clinically meaningful differences ({$>$}5\%) from TG-43 were observed. Accurate dosimetric modeling of shielded applicators may help to refine organ toxicity studies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the dosimetric impact of the heterogeneity dose calculation Acuros (Transpire Inc., Gig Harbor, WA), a grid-based Boltzmann equation solver (GBBS), for brachytherapy in a cohort of cervical cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The impact of heterogeneities was retrospectively assessed in treatment plans for 26 patients who had previously received (192)Ir intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer with computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance-compatible tandems and unshielded colpostats. The GBBS models sources, patient boundaries, applicators, and tissue heterogeneities. Multiple GBBS calculations were performed with and without solid model applicator, with and without overriding the patient contour to 1 g/cm(3) muscle, and with and without overriding contrast materials to muscle or 2.25 g/cm(3) bone. Impact of source and boundary modeling, applicator, tissue heterogeneities, and sensitivity of CT-to-material mapping of contrast were derived from the multiple calculations. American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 43 (TG-43) guidelines and the GBBS were compared for the following clinical dosimetric parameters: Manchester points A and B, International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) report 38 rectal and bladder points, three and nine o'clock, and (D2cm3) to the bladder, rectum, and sigmoid. RESULTS: Points A and B, D(2) cm(3) bladder, ICRU bladder, and three and nine o'clock were within 5\% of TG-43 for all GBBS calculations. The source and boundary and applicator account for most of the differences between the GBBS and TG-43 guidelines. The D(2cm3) rectum (n = 3), D(2cm3) sigmoid (n = 1), and ICRU rectum (n = 6) had differences of {$>$}5\% from TG-43 for the worst case incorrect mapping of contrast to bone. Clinical dosimetric parameters were within 5\% of TG-43 when rectal and balloon contrast were mapped to bone and radiopaque packing was not overridden. CONCLUSIONS: The GBBS has minimal impact on clinical parameters for this cohort of patients with unshielded applicators. The incorrect mapping of rectal and balloon contrast does not have a significant impact on clinical parameters. Rectal parameters may be sensitive to the mapping of radiopaque packing.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 25-center study enrolled 208 patients with biopsy-proven invasive cervical cancer for MRI and CT before attempted curative radical hysterectomy. Each imaging study was interpreted prospectively by one onsite radiologist and retrospectively by four independent offsite radiologists, who were all blinded to surgical, histopathologic, and other imaging findings. Likelihood of cervical stromal and uterine body involvement was rated on a 5-point scale. Tumor size measurements were attempted in three axes. Surgical pathology was the standard of reference. RESULTS: Neither MRI nor CT was accurate for evaluating cervical stroma. For uterine body involvement, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was higher for MRI than for CT for both prospective (0.80 v 0.66, respectively; P = .01) and retrospective (0.68 v 0.57, respectively; P = .02) readings. Retrospective readers could measure diameter by CT in 35\% to 73\% of patients and by MRI in 79\% to 94\% of patients. Prospective readers had the highest Spearman correlation coefficient with pathologic measurement for MRI (r(s) = 0.54), followed by CT (r(s) = 0.45) and clinical examination (r(s) = 0.37; P {$<$} .0001 for all). Spearman correlation of multiobserver diameter measurements for MRI (r(s) = 0.58; P {$<$} .0001) was double that for CT (r(s) = 0.27; P = .03). CONCLUSION: In patients with cervical cancer, MRI is superior to CT and clinical examination for evaluating uterine body involvement and measuring tumor size, but no method was accurate for evaluating cervical stroma.},

Treatment modalities were defined and related to outcomes and side effects. Material and methods: From a single cancer center, 138 patients with advanced cervical cancer were recruited. All patients were treated with external radiotherapy and IGABT. A dosimetric study was performed and related to treatment outcome and side effects. Toxicity of the organs at risk was evaluated by the CTCAE-grading system. Results: The median follow-up was 44 months. More than 60\% of the tumors were FIGO stage IIB-IIIB and 82\% were squamous cell carcinomas. Largest tumor size (width) was in mean 41 mm and 27\% had lymph node spread. The mean total external dose was 51 Gy, and the mean total dose to the high-risk clinical target volume (HRCTV) was 88 Gy. In 130 patients (94\%), weekly cisplatin was given in 4-6 cycles. The median number of brachytherapy fractions was four, and in 86 patients, interstitial needles were applied. The primary local control was 97\% and 94\% after four local recurrences. The overall pelvic control was 89\%. The overall recurrence rate was 25\% and distant metastases rate was 22\%. The overall 5-year survival rate was 65\% and cancer-specific survival rate was 69\%. Prognostic factors were FIGO stage and total brachytherapy dose (D90) to HRCTV. Late serious toxicity of the bladder and intestine were rare, occurring in only 3\% of patients. Conclusions: The local and pelvic control rates were excellent in this series. The IGABT was an important part of the treatment schedule and could probably not be replaced by increasing the external pelvic dose. Adenocarcinomas seemed to benefit from the addition of interstitial needles. Late serious toxicity was rare.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This report presents guidelines for using high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in the management of patients with cervical cancer, taking into consideration the current availability of resources in most institutions. METHODS: Members of the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) with expertise in HDR brachytherapy for cervical cancer performed a literature review, supplemented their clinical experience to formulate guidelines for HDR brachytherapy of cervical cancer. RESULTS: The ABS strongly recommends that definitive irradiation for cervical carcinoma must include brachytherapy as a component. Each institution should follow a consistent treatment policy when performing HDR brachytherapy, including complete documentation of treatment parameters and correlation with clinical outcome, such as pelvic control, survival, and complications. The goals are to treat Point A to at least a total low-dose-rate (LDR) equivalent of 80-85 Gy for early stage disease and 85-90 Gy for advanced stage. The pelvic sidewall dose recommendations are 50-55 Gy for early lesions and 55-65 Gy for advanced ones. The relative doses given by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) vs. brachytherapy depend upon the initial volume of disease, the ability to displace the bladder and rectum, the degree of tumor regression during pelvic irradiation, and institutional preference. As with LDR brachytherapy, every attempt should be made to keep the bladder and rectal doses below 80 Gy and 75 Gy LDR equivalent doses, respectively. Interstitial brachytherapy should be considered for patients with disease that cannot be optimally encompassed by intracavitary brachytherapy. While recognizing that many efficacious HDR fractionation schedules exist, some suggested dose and fractionation schemes for combining the EBRT with HDR brachytherapy for each stage of disease are presented. These recommendations are intended only as guidelines, and the suggested fractionation schemes have not been thoroughly tested. The responsibility for the medical decisions ultimately rests with the treating radiation oncologist. CONCLUSION: Guidelines are established for HDR brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Practitioners and cooperative groups are encouraged to use these guidelines to formulate their treatment and dose-reporting policies. These guidelines will be modified, as image-based treatment becomes more widely available.},

  abstract = {The current clinical practice for cervical cancer intracavitary brachytherapy in most centers is to prescribe the dose to point A. However, this is an empirical point and does not necessarily reflect dose to the tumor. Although 3-dimensional image-based treatment planning is extensively used in prostate brachytherapy, only a few institutions have used it to shape the dose distribution in cervical brachytherapy. To facilitate and standardize image-based dosimetry for cervical cancer brachytherapy, the American Image-guided Brachytherapy Working Group and the European Gynecological GEC-ESTRO Working Group have recently proposed nomenclature for volume definition and recommendations for image-based intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer. The recommendations of the 2 groups are very similar and are discussed together in this article. Proposals are made for research in image-based brachytherapy for cervical cancer. At a recent transatlantic image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy workshop (Chicago, IL, July 28, 2005), it was suggested that because the recommendations are so similar and to prevent confusion, the nomenclature suggested by the European Group be adopted and future joint contouring workshops be organized to facilitate image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate the feasibility and use of dose points to characterize the bladder wall dose distribution and investigate potential impact of the applicator position in cervical cancer brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred twenty-eight optimized MRI plans were evaluated. The International Commission of Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU-38) point doses (B(ICRU)), surrogate for bladder base doses, were compared with D(2cc). Vaginal source to superior-anterior border of the symphysis distances were measured and compared within two groups, namely Group 1-B(ICRU)/D(2cc) {$\geq$}1 and Group 2-B(ICRU)/D(2cc) {$<$}1. Additionally, points at 1.5 and 2 cm cranial to the B(ICRU), parallel to the tandem and the body axis were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of the patients had the ratio B(ICRU)/D(2cc) of 1 or higher, with the 2cc subvolume at the bladder base (Group 1). In 63\%, BICRU/D2cc ratio was lower than 1 and the 2cc, cranial to the bladder base (Group 2). Median vaginal source-to-superior-anterior border of the symphysis line distance was -2 cm (range, -3.7 to +1.2 cm) in Group 1 and +1.8 cm (range, -2 to +4.8 cm) in Group 2 (+ cranial/- caudal direction). There was a high correlation between vaginal sources near the symphysis and the 2cc subvolume at the bladder base. The additional points provided no added value. CONCLUSIONS: Location of the 2cc subvolume varies in cervical cancer brachytherapy. Maximum doses are at the bladder base if vaginal sources are also in the vicinity of the bladder base indicated by B(ICRU)/D(2cc) ratio of 1 or higher. Such variation should be considered in dose-effect analyses and intercomparisons, as the same D(2cc) at different bladder locations may correlate with different morbidity profiles and severity Reporting D(2cc) and B(ICRU) doses together therefore remains essential.},

METHOD: This retrospective analysis includes 46 patients treated between 2006 and 2008. Dose-volume parameters D90 HR-CTV (high-risk clinical target volume) and D(2cc) OARs (organs at risk) were determined and converted into biologically equivalent doses in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). Clinical outcome parameters (local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)) were analysed actuarially and late morbidity crude rates were scored using CTCAEv3.0. RESULTS: Mean D90 HR-CTV was 84 (SD9) Gy EQD2 for HR-CTV volumes of mean 57 (SD37) cm(3) at time of first brachytherapy (BT). Median follow-up was 41 (range, 4-67) months. Three year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 93, 71, and 65\%, respectively. Node negative patients had significantly higher 3-year survival rates compared to node positive ones (PFS 85 versus 53\% (p=0.013), OS 77 versus 50\% (p=0.032), respectively) with an even larger difference for patients with FIGO stages IB-IIB (PFS 87 versus 42\% (p=0.002), OS 83 versus 46\% (p=0.007), respectively). Late grade 3-4 mainly gastrointestinal or vaginal morbidity was observed in 4 patients (9.5\%). No correlations were seen between morbidity and D(2cc) OAR values. CONCLUSION: (Chemo-) radiation and MR-IGABT with tandem-ovoid applicators result in high LC and promising survival rates with reasonable morbidity.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to investigate the benefit of the Utrecht interstitial CT/MR applicator for combined intracavitary/interstitial (IC/IS) approach, using magnetic resonance imaging-guided brachytherapy, over the intracavitary approach alone in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer and to analyze the clinical use of needles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study includes the first 20 patients treated with the new applicator. Brachytherapy consisted of two pulsed dose rate applications, and the second application was performed with the IC/IS approach. The number of needles, chosen guiding holes through the ovoids, and insertion depths were based on the dose distribution and dosimetric shortcomings of the first application (IC alone). We investigated the dosimetric gain by comparing the clinical interstitial optimized plan (IC/IS(clinical)) with an additionally generated optimized plan without needle use (IC(study)). Furthermore, we studied the relation of the inserted needles and their source loading patterns with the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV). RESULTS: A total of 54 needles (range, 1-6 per application) were applied with an average depth of 25 mm. The chosen needle positions corresponded with the location of the HR-CTV extensions. The total and individual needle treatment times per application were on average 19\% (range, 4-35\%) and 7\% (range, 2-14\%) of the implant treatment time, respectively. The total (external-beam radiotherapy + brachytherapy) D90 HR-CTV for the IC(study) and the IC/IS(clinical) were on average 79.5 (SD 7.4) Gy({$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}10) and 83.9 (SD 6.7) Gy({$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}10), respectively, with an average gain of 4.4 (SD 2.3) Gy({$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}10) for the second application. CONCLUSIONS: Needle placement was feasible in all patients and resulted in a gain in dose and better coverage of HR-CTV. Defining the location of HR-CTV protrusions and analyzing the associated needles has given us deeper understanding of the possibilities in magnetic resonance imaging-guided (pre)treatment planning with the IC/IS Utrecht applicator.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as the imaging modality for image-guided brachytherapy. In locally advanced cervical carcinoma, combined endocavitary and interstitial applicators are appropriate (Vienna or Utrecht). To cover extensive disease, Template Benidorm (TB) was developed. Treatment planning system applicator libraries are currently unavailable for the Utrecht applicator or the TB. The purpose of this work is to develop an applicator library for both applicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The library developed in this work has been used in the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS, version 4.3.0, which has a brachytherapy module that includes a library of rigid applicators. To add the needles of the Utrecht applicator and to model the TB, we used FreeCAD and MeshLab. The reconstruction process was based on the points that the rigid section and the interstitial part have in common. This, together with the free length, allowed us to ascertain the position of the tip. RESULTS: In case of the Utrecht applicator, one of the sources of uncertainty in the reconstruction was determining the distance of the tip of needle from the ovoid. In case of the TB, the large number of needles involved made their identification time consuming. The developed library resolved both issues. CONCLUSIONS: The developed library for the Utrecht and TB is feasible and efficient improving accuracy. It allows all the required treatment planning to proceed using just a T2 MRI sequence. The additional use of specific free available software applications makes it possible to add this information to the already existing library of the Oncentra Brachytherapy TPS. Specific details not included on this manuscript will be available under request. This library is also currently being implemented also into the Sagiplan v 2.0 TPS.},

  abstract = {This work presents BrachyGuide, a brachytherapy-dedicated software tool for the automatic preparation of input files for Monte Carlo simulation from treatment plans exported in DICOM RT format, and results of calculations performed for its benchmarking. Three plans were prepared using two computational models, the image series of a water sphere and a multicatheter breast brachytherapy patient, for each of two commercially available treatment planning systems: BrachyVision and Oncentra Brachy. One plan involved a single source dwell position of an 192Ir HDR source (VS2000 or mHDR-v2) at the center of the water sphere using the TG43 algorithm, and the other two corresponded to the TG43 and advanced dose calculation algorithm for the multicatheter breast brachytherapy patient. Monte Carlo input files were prepared using BrachyGuide and simulations were performed with MCNP v.6.1. For the TG43 patient plans, the Monte Carlo computational model was manually edited in the prepared input files to resemble TG43 dosimetry assumptions. Hence all DICOM RT dose exports were equivalent to corresponding simulation results and their comparison was used for benchmarking the use of BrachyGuide. Monte Carlo simulation results and corresponding DICOM RT dose exports agree within type A uncertainties in the majority of points in the computational models. Treatment planning system, algorithm, and source specific differences greater than type A uncertainties were also observed, but these were explained by treatment planning system-related issues and other sources of type B uncertainty. These differences have to be taken into account in commissioning procedures of brachytherapy dosimetry algorithms. BrachyGuide is accurate and effective for use in the preparation of commissioning tests for new brachytherapy dosimetry algorithms as a user-oriented commissioning tool and the expedition of retrospective patient cohort studies of dosimetry planning.},

CT-MR compatible tandem plus colpostats (T/C) (Nucletron) is widely used in cervical brachytherapy. The major challenge of MRI is the lack of dummy catheters. Therefore, an additional imaging modality is usually required. One disadvantage of sliced-based reconstruction is that resolution in longitudinal directions can be affected by the slice thickness. The aim of this study is to present a modified T/C applicator in which the catheter visibility is significantly improved. Methods and materials A modification to the existing T/C applicator has been made available, increasing the catheter entrance diameter. It allows a greater dummy catheter diameter, and consequently it can be filled with more material per unit length. Visibility was studied with different materials. Results The catheter filled with saline water plus iodine compound was clearly seen in both axial and longitudinal acquisitions. To avoid uncertainties introduced by the slice thickness, a simple procedure is presented using longitudinal acquisitions. Conclusions The modified applicator plus catheter allows a powerful signal in T2 weighted MRI, using a very simple and accessible material. Also, a method is proposed to solve the problem of the uncertainty derived from slice thickness using few longitudinal acquisitions.},

We aimed to assess feasibility and efficacy of MRI-assisted pre-planning, based on applicator insertion in para-cervical anaesthesia (PCA).

Procedure tolerability was assessed. High risk clinical target volume (HR CTV) and organs at risk were delineated on the pre-planning MRI, virtual needles placed at optimal positions, and dose planning performed. At BT, insertion was carried out in subarachnoidal anaesthesia according to pre-planned geometry. Pre-planned and actual treatment parameters were compared. RESULTS: Pre-planning procedure was well tolerated. Median difference between the pre-planned and actual needle insertion depth and position were 2 (0-10) mm and 4 (0-30) degrees, respectively. The differences between the pre-planned and actual geometric and dosimetric parameters were statistically non-significant. All actual needles were positioned inside the HR CTV and outside the organs at risk (OAR). CONCLUSIONS: Our pre-planning approach is well tolerated and effective. Pre-planned geometry and dose distribution can be reproduced at BT.},

METHODS: Treatment schedule was EBRT with 45-50.4Gy{$\pm$}concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy plus 4\texttimes 7Gy High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Patients were treated in the "protocol period" (2001-2008) with the prospective application of the High Risk CTV concept (D90) and dose volume constraints for organs at risk including biological modelling. Dose volume adaptation was performed with the aim of dose escalation in large tumours (prescribed D90{$>$}85Gy), often with inserting additional interstitial needles. Dose volume constraints (D(2cc)) were 70-75Gy for rectum and sigmoid and 90Gy for bladder. Late morbidity was prospectively scored, using LENT/SOMA Score. Disease outcome and treatment related late morbidity were evaluated and compared using actuarial analysis. FINDINGS: One hundred and fifty-six consecutive patients (median age 58years) with cervix cancer FIGO stages IB-IVA were treated with definitive radiotherapy in curative intent. Histology was squamous cell cancer in 134 patients (86\%), tumour size was {$>$}5cm in 103 patients (66\%), lymph node involvement in 75 patients (48\%).

Overall local control at 3years was 95\%; 98\% for tumours 2-5cm, and 92\% for tumours {$>$}5cm (p=0.04), 100\% for IB, 96\% for IIB, 86\% for IIIB. Cancer specific survival at 3years was overall 74\%, 83\% for tumours 2-5cm, 70\% for tumours {$>$}5cm, 83\% for IB, 84\% for IIB, 52\% for IIIB. Overall survival at 3years was in total 68\%, 72\% for tumours 2-5cm, 65\% for tumours {$>$}5cm, 74\% for IB, 78\% for IIB, 45\% for IIIB. In regard to late morbidity in total 188 grade 1+2 and 11 grade 3+4 late events were observed in 143 patients. G1+2/G3+4 events for bladder were n=32/3, for rectum n=14/5, for bowel (including sigmoid) n=3/0, for vagina n=128/2, respectively. INTERPRETATION: 3D conformal radiotherapy{$\pm$}chemotherapy plus image (MRI) guided adaptive intracavitary brachytherapy including needle insertion in advanced disease results in local control rates of 95-100\% at 3years in limited/favourable (IB/IIB) and 85-90\% in large/poor response (IIB/III/IV) cervix cancer patients associated with a moderate rate of treatment related morbidity. Compared to the historical Vienna series there is relative reduction in pelvic recurrence by 65-70\% and reduction in major morbidity. The local control improvement seems to have impact on CSS and OS. Prospective clinical multi-centre studies are mandatory to evaluate these challenging mono-institutional findings.},

  abstract = {The publication of the GEC-ESTRO recommendations one decade ago was a significant step forward for reaching international consensus on adaptive target definition and dose reporting in image guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) in locally advanced cervical cancer. Since then, IGABT has been spreading, particularly in Europe, North America and Asia, and the guidelines have proved their broad acceptance and applicability in clinical practice. However, a unified approach to volume contouring and reporting does not imply a unified administration of treatment, and currently both external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and IGABT are delivered using a large variety of techniques and prescription/fractionation schedules. With IGABT, local control is excellent in limited and well-responding tumours. The major challenges are currently loco-regional control in advanced tumours, treatment-related morbidity, and distant metastatic disease. Emerging evidence from the RetroEMBRACE and EMBRACE I studies has demonstrated that clinical outcome is related to dose prescription and technique. The next logical step is to demonstrate excellent clinical outcome with the most advanced EBRT and brachytherapy techniques based on an evidence-based prospective dose and volume prescription protocol. The EMBRACE II study is an interventional and observational multicentre study which aims to benchmark a high level of local, nodal and systemic control while limiting morbidity, using state of the art treatment including an advanced target volume selection and contouring protocol for EBRT and brachytherapy, a multi-parametric brachytherapy dose prescription protocol (clinical validation of dose constraints), and use of advanced EBRT (IMRT and IGRT) and brachytherapy (IC/IS) techniques (clinical validation). The study also incorporates translational research including imaging and tissue biomarkers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concept of the use of MRI for image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) in locally advanced cervical cancer was introduced 20 years ago. Here, we report on EMBRACE-I, which aimed to evaluate local tumour control and morbidity after chemoradiotherapy and MRI-based IGABT. METHODS: EMBRACE-I was a prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study. Data from patients from 24 centres in Europe, Asia, and North America were prospectively collected. The inclusion criteria were patients older than 18 years, with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix, The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB-IVA disease or FIGO stage IVB disease restricted to paraaortic lymph metastasis below the L1-L2 interspace, suitable for curative treatment. Treatment consisted of chemoradiotherapy (weekly intravenous cisplatin 40 mg/m2, 5-6 cycles, 1 day per cycle, plus 45-50 Gy external-beam radiotherapy delivered in 1{$\cdot$}8-2 Gy fractions) followed by MRI-based IGABT. The MRI-based IGABT target volume definition and dose reporting was according to Groupe Europ\'een de Curieth\'erapie European Society for Radiation Oncology recommendations. IGABT dose prescription was open according to institutional practice. Local control and late morbidity were selected as primary endpoints in all patients available for analysis. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00920920. FINDINGS: Patient accrual began on July 30, 2008, and closed on Dec 29, 2015. A total of 1416 patients were registered in the database. After exclusion for not meeting patient selection criteria before treatment, being registered but not entered in the database, meeting the exclusion criteria, and being falsely excluded, data from 1341 patients were available for analysis of disease and data from 1251 patients were available for assessment of morbidity outcome. MRI-based IGABT including dose optimisation was done in 1317 (98{$\cdot$}2\%) of 1341 patients. Median high-risk clinical target volume was 28 cm3 (IQR 20-40) and median minimal dose to 90\% of the clinical target volume (D90\%) was 90 Gy (IQR 85-94) equi-effective dose in 2 Gy per fraction. At a median follow-up of 51 months (IQR 20-64), actuarial overall 5-year local control was 92\% (95\% CI 90-93). Actuarial cumulative 5-year incidence of grade 3-5 morbidity was 6{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 5{$\cdot$}4-8{$\cdot$}6) for genitourinary events, 8{$\cdot$}5\% (6{$\cdot$}9-10{$\cdot$}6) for gastrointestinal events, 5{$\cdot$}7\% (4{$\cdot$}3-7{$\cdot$}6) for vaginal events, and 3{$\cdot$}2\% (2{$\cdot$}2-4{$\cdot$}5) for fistulae. INTERPRETATION: Chemoradiotherapy and MRI-based IGABT result in effective and stable long-term local control across all stages of locally advanced cervical cancer, with a limited severe morbidity per organ. These results represent a positive breakthrough in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, which might be used as a benchmark for clinical practice and all future studies.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Image guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) for cervical cancer, using mainly MRI, is an evolving method, increasingly replacing the 2D approach based on conventional radiography. During the complex 4D chain of this procedure image-assistance is provided for disease assessment, provisional treatment planning ("pre-planning"), applicator placement and reconstruction, as well as for contouring, definitive treatment planning and quality control of dose delivery. With IGABT changes of topography adjacent to the applicator, caused by tumour regression, oedema, organ changes and dilation are identified. Thus, the CTV for IGABT is primarily based on the tumour volume at the time of BT and takes into account both time and spatial domains. IGABT requires systematic concepts for target, OAR, biological modelling, DVH analysis, and dose-volume-adaptation. METHODS AND RESULTS: This report focuses on the advantages and uncertainties, dose-effect relations and clinical results of the IGABT procedure addressing the current status and future perspectives. Uncertainties during the 4D chain of IGABT are mainly related to target contouring, applicator reconstruction, as well as to inter-fraction, intra-fraction and inter-application variability, as caused by tumour response and organ changes. Different from EBRT where set-up uncertainties are compensated by adding a margin to the CTV, no margins to the lateral and anterior-posterior directions can be used for IGABT. DISCUSSION: By 3D treatment planning for IGABT significant improvement of the DVH parameters is achieved compared to 2D library plans. In small tumours the benefit is primarily obtained by a decrease of dose to nearby OAR while in large tumours the use of supplementary interstitial techniques and optimization may double the target volume that can be treated at a therapeutic dose level. The clinical impact of IGABT could recently be demonstrated by the establishment of some correlations between target- and organ-related DVH parameters versus disease control and side effects, which need further clarification. Overall, a very high local control rate can be achieved with minor treatment related morbidity. This favourable therapeutic ratio seems to be now reproducible under different conditions at various treatment centres. These results have to be validated within the upcoming multi-centre prospective IntErnational study on MRI-guided brachytherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer (EMBRACE).},

  abstract = {The second part of the GYN GEC ESTRO working group recommendations is focused on 3D dose-volume parameters for brachytherapy of cervical carcinoma. Methods and parameters have been developed and validated from dosimetric, imaging and clinical experience from different institutions (University of Vienna, IGR Paris, University of Leuven). Cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH) are recommended for evaluation of the complex dose heterogeneity. DVH parameters for GTV, HR CTV and IR CTV are the minimum dose delivered to 90 and 100\% of the respective volume: D90, D100. The volume, which is enclosed by 150 or 200\% of the prescribed dose (V150, V200), is recommended for overall assessment of high dose volumes. V100 is recommended for quality assessment only within a given treatment schedule. For Organs at Risk (OAR) the minimum dose in the most irradiated tissue volume is recommended for reporting: 0.1, 1, and 2 cm3; optional 5 and 10 cm3. Underlying assumptions are: full dose of external beam therapy in the volume of interest, identical location during fractionated brachytherapy, contiguous volumes and contouring of organ walls for {$>$}2 cm3. Dose values are reported as absorbed dose and also taking into account different dose rates. The linear-quadratic radiobiological model-equivalent dose (EQD2)-is applied for brachytherapy and is also used for calculating dose from external beam therapy. This formalism allows systematic assessment within one patient, one centre and comparison between different centres with analysis of dose volume relations for GTV, CTV, and OAR. Recommendations for the transition period from traditional to 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy are formulated. Supplementary data (available in the electronic version of this paper) deals with aspects of 3D imaging, radiation physics, radiation biology, dose at reference points and dimensions and volumes for the GTV and CTV (adding to [Haie-Meder C, P\"otter R, Van Limbergen E et al. Recommendations from Gynaecological (GYN) GEC ESTRO Working Group (I): concepts and terms in 3D image-based 3D treatment planning in cervix cancer brachytherapy with emphasis on MRI assessment of GTV and CTV. Radiother Oncol 2005;74:235-245]). It is expected that the therapeutic ratio including target coverage and sparing of organs at risk can be significantly improved, if radiation dose is prescribed to a 3D image-based CTV taking into account dose volume constraints for OAR. However, prospective use of these recommendations in the clinical context is warranted, to further explore and develop the potential of 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To define, in the setting of cervical cancer, to what extent information from additional pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without the brachytherapy applicator improves conformity of CT-based high-risk clinical target volume (CTVHR) contours, compared with the MRI for various tumor stages (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stages I-IVA). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CTVHR was contoured in 39 patients with cervical cancer (FIGO stages I-IVA) (1) on CT images based on clinical information (CTVHR-CTClinical) alone; and (2) using an additional MRI before brachytherapy, without the applicator (CTVHR-CTpre-BT MRI). The CT contours were compared with reference contours on MRI with the applicator in place (CTVHR-MRIref). Width, height, thickness, volumes, and topography were analyzed. RESULTS: The CT-MRIref differences hardly varied in stage I tumors (n=8). In limited-volume stage IIB and IIIB tumors (n=19), CTVHR-CTpre-BT MRI-MRIref volume differences (2.6 cm(3) [IIB], 7.3 cm(3) [IIIB]) were superior to CTVHR-CTClinical-MRIref (11.8 cm(3) [IIB], 22.9 cm(3) [IIIB]), owing to significant improvement of height and width (P{$<$}.05). In advanced disease (n=12), improved agreement with MR volume, width, and height was achieved for CTVHR-CTpre-BT MRI. In 5 of 12 cases, MRIref contours were partly missed on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-BT MRI helps to define CTVHR before BT implantation appropriately, if only CT images with the applicator in place are available for BT planning. Significant improvement is achievable in limited-volume stage IIB and IIIB tumors. In more advanced disease (extensive IIB to IVA), improvement of conformity is possible but may be associated with geographic misses. Limited impact on precision of CTVHR-CT is expected in stage IB tumors.},

  abstract = {Accurate segmentation of gliomas on routine magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans plays an important role in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and patient treatment planning. We present a fully automated approach, radiomics-based convolutional neural network (RadCNN), for segmenting both high- and low-grade gliomas using multimodal MRI volumes (T1c, T2w, and FLAIR). RadCNN incorporates radiomic texture features (i.e., Haralick, Gabor, and Laws) within DeepMedic [a deep 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation framework that uses image intensities; a top performing method in the BraTS 2016 challenge] to further augment the performance of brain tumor subcompartment segmentation. We first identify textural radiomic representations that best separate the different subcompartments [enhancing tumor (ET), whole tumor (WT), and tumor core (TC)] on the training set, and then feed these representations as inputs to the CNN classifier for prediction of different subcompartments. We hypothesize that textural radiomic representations of lesion subcompartments will enhance the separation of subcompartment boundaries, and hence providing these features as inputs to the deep CNN, over and above raw intensity values alone, will improve the subcompartment segmentation. Using a training set of N = 241 patients, validation set of N = 44, and test set of N = 46 patients, RadCNN method achieved Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores of 0.71, 0.89, and 0.73 for ET, WT, and TC, respectively. Compared to the DeepMedic model, RadCNN showed improvement in DSC scores for both ET and WT and demonstrated comparable results in segmenting the TC. Similarly, smaller Hausdorff distance measures were obtained with RadCNN as compared to the DeepMedic model across all the subcompartments. Following the segmentation of the different subcompartments, we extracted a set of subcompartment specific radiomic descriptors that capture lesion disorder and assessed their ability in separating patients into different survival cohorts (short-, mid- and long-term survival) based on their overall survival from the date of baseline diagnosis. Using a multilinear regression approach, we achieved accuracies of 0.57, 0.63, and 0.45 for the training, validation, and test cases, respectively.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: There are perineal templates for interstitial implants such as MUPIT and Syed applicators. Their limitations are the intracavitary component deficit and the necessity to use computed tomography (CT) for treatment planning since both applicators are non-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibles. To overcome these problems, a new template named Template Benidorm (TB) has been recently developed. Titanium needles are usually reconstructed based on their own artifacts, mainly in T1-weighted sequence, using the void on the tip as the needle tip position. Nevertheless, patient tissues surrounding the needles present heterogeneities that complicate the accurate identification of these artifact patterns. The purpose of this work is to improve the titanium needle reconstruction uncertainty for the TB case using a simple method based on the free needle lengths and typical MRI pellets markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed procedure consists on the inclusion of three small A-vitamin pellets (hyperintense on MRI images) compressed by both applicator plates defining the central plane of the plate's arrangement. The needles used are typically 20 cm in length. For each needle, two points are selected defining the straight line. From such line and the plane equations, the intersection can be obtained, and using the free length (knowing the offset distance), the coordinates of the needle tip can be obtained. The method is applied in both T1W and T2W acquisition sequences. To evaluate the inter-observer variation of the method, three implants of T1W and another three of T2W have been reconstructed by two different medical physicists with experience on these reconstructions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The differences observed in the positioning were significantly smaller than 1 mm in all cases. The presented algorithm also allows the use of only T2W sequence either for contouring or reconstruction purposes. The proposed method is robust and independent of the visibility of the artifact at the tip of the needle.},

  abstract = {Brachytherapy plays an essential role in the curative intent management of locally advanced cervical cancer. The introduction of the magnetic resonance (MR) as a preferred image modality and the development of new type of applicators with interstitial components have further improved its benefits. The aim of this work is to review the current status of one important aspect in the cervix cancer brachytherapy procedure, namely catheter reconstruction. MR compatible intracavitary and interstitial applicators are described. Considerations about the use of MR imaging (MRI) regarding appropriate strategies for applicator reconstruction, technical requirements, MR sequences, patient preparation and applicator commissioning are included. It is recommendable to perform the reconstruction process in the same image study employed by the physician for contouring, that is, T2 weighted (T2W) sequences. Nevertheless, a clear identification of the source path inside the catheters and the applicators is a challenge when using exclusively T2W sequences. For the intracavitary component of the implant, sometimes the catheters may be filled with some substance that produces a high intensity signal on MRI. However, this strategy is not feasible for plastic tubes or titanium needles, which, moreover, induce magnetic susceptibility artifacts. In these situations, the use of applicator libraries available in the treatment planning system (TPS) is useful, since they not only include accurate geometrical models of the intracavitary applicators, but also recent developments have made possible the implementation of the interstitial component. Another strategy to improve the reconstruction process is based on the incorporation of MR markers, such as small pellets, to be used as anchor points. Many institutions employ computed tomography (CT) as a supporting image modality. The registration of CT and MR image sets should be carefully performed, and its uncertainty previously assessed. Besides, an important research work is being carried out regarding the use of ultrasound and electromagnetic tracking technologies.},

  abstract = {For locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), anatomy correspondence with and without BT applicator needs to be quantified to merge the delivered doses of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT). This study proposed and evaluated different deformable image registration (DIR) methods for this application. Twenty patients who underwent EBRT and BT for LACC were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient had a pre-BT CT at EBRT boost (without applicator) and a CT and MRI at BT (with applicator). The evaluated DIR methods were the diffeomorphic Demons, commercial intensity and hybrid methods, and three different biomechanical models. The biomechanical models considered different boundary conditions (BCs). The impact of the BT devices insertion on the anatomy was quantified. DIR method performances were quantified using geometric criteria between the original and deformed contours. The BT dose was deformed toward the pre-CT BT by each DIR method. The impact of boundary conditions to drive the biomechanical model was evaluated based on the deformation vector field and dose differences. The GEC-ESTRO guideline dose indices were reported. Large organ displacements, deformations, and volume variations were observed between the pre-BT and BT anatomies. Rigid registration and intensity-based DIR resulted in poor geometric accuracy with mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) inferior to 0.57, 0.63, 0.42, 0.32, and 0.43 for the rectum, bladder, vagina, cervix and uterus, respectively. Biomechanical models provided a mean DSC of 0.96 for all the organs. By considering the cervix-uterus as one single structure, biomechanical models provided a mean DSC of 0.88 and 0.94 for the cervix and uterus, respectively. The deformed doses were represented for each DIR method. Caution should be used when performing DIR for this application as standard techniques may have unacceptable results. The biomechanical model with the cervix-uterus as one structure provided the most realistic deformations to propagate the BT dose toward the EBRT boost anatomy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since the Group Europ\'een de Curieth\'erapie and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) published recommendations for 3D MRI-based image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGBT) in the treatment of cervical cancer, many institutions have implemented this technique and favourable results were documented. We investigated if introduction of IGBT in our centre indeed improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity compared to conventional brachytherapy (CBT). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done of outcomes of patients with stage IB-IVA cervical cancer treated with primary radiation therapy with curative intent between 2000 and 2012. Outcome measures were overall and disease-free survival, pelvic control, distant metastasis and treatment related adverse events (AE). RESULTS: 126 patients were analysed; 43 had been treated with CBT between 2000-2007, and 83 with IGBT between 2007-2012. External beam radiation (mean; 46.6Gy) was combined with concurrent weekly cisplatin (51.6\%), or hyperthermia (24.6\%); radiation alone was used in 23.8\%. Median follow-up was 121.8months for CBT patients, vs. 42.3months for IGBT. Complete remission was achieved in 83.7\% of patients in the CBT group and in 98.8\% of IGBT patients (p{$<$}0.01). Overall survival at 3years was 51\% and 86\%, respectively (p=0.001). Pelvic recurrence was found in 32\% vs. 7\% (p{$<$}0.001). Most patients had low grade adverse events. High grade (3-4) AE occurred in 15.4\% vs. 8.4\% at 3years (p=0.06). CONCLUSION: Introduction of IGBT for cervical cancer has led to significantly increased 3-year locoregional control and survival rates, whilst reducing late morbidity.},

  abstract = {When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time-to-event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of {$\geq$}0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of {$\leq$} 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R2, and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox-Snell R2, which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.},

Many of these sources have satisfied the AAPM prerequisites for routine clinical purposes and are posted on the Brachytherapy Source Registry managed jointly by the AAPM and the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston Quality Assurance Center (IROC Houston). Given increasingly closer interactions among physicists in North America and Europe, the AAPM and the Groupe Europ\'een de Curieth\'erapie-European Society for Radiotherapy \& Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) have prepared another supplement containing recommended brachytherapy dosimetry parameters for eleven low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources. The current report presents consensus datasets approved by the AAPM and GEC-ESTRO. The following sources are included: 125 I sources (BEBIG model I25.S17, BEBIG model I25.S17plus, BEBIG model I25.S18, Elekta model 130.002, Oncura model 9011, and Theragenics model AgX100); 103 Pd sources (CivaTech Oncology model CS10, IBt model 1031L, IBt model 1032P, and IsoAid model IAPd-103A); and 131 Cs (IsoRay Medical model CS-1 Rev2). Observations are included on the behavior of these dosimetry parameters as a function of radionuclide. Recommendations are presented on the selection of dosimetry parameters, such as from societal reports issuing consensus datasets (e.g., TG-43U1, AAPM Report \#229), the joint AAPM/IROC Houston Registry, the GEC-ESTRO website, the Carleton University website, and those included in software releases from vendors of treatment planning systems. Aspects such as timeliness, maintenance, and rigor of these resources are discussed. Links to reference data are provided for radionuclides (radiation spectra and half-lives) and dose scoring materials (compositions and mass densities). The recent literature is examined on photon energy response corrections for thermoluminescent dosimetry of low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources. Depending upon the dosimetry parameters currently used by individual physicists, use of these recommended consensus datasets may result in changes to patient dose calculations. These changes must be carefully evaluated and reviewed with the radiation oncologist prior to their implementation.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To present the implementation of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-planning technique in multi-interstitial perineal and endocavitary gynecological brachytherapy. Material and methods: We used a new fully MRI-compatible applicator that is capable to engage titanium needles, and an intrauterine tandem, developed in our department for the treatment of gynecological cervical cancer patients. This applicator is an attempt to combine the technical advantages of the Martinez universal perineal interstitial template (MUPIT) with the improvement in dose distribution by adding an intrauterine probe with the imaging advantages of MRI-based brachytherapy, thus preserving the stability, geometry, and robustness of the implant, avoiding possible errors of free-hand needle placement. A pre-brachytherapy MRI T2 acquisition is carried out with the template in place 3-5 days before the implant. On this image set, clinical target volume (CTV) is drawn. The required needles and their depths are selected accordingly to encompass the CTV (as conformal as possible). To facilitate this task, a Java based application linked to the treatment planning system has been developed. From this procedure, each needle identification and its depth are obtained previously to the implantation. With this information, the radiation oncologist proceeds with implant and then, a post-implant MRI is carried out, in which the contouring, needles, tandem reconstruction, and optimization are established. Results: This pre-planning procedure has been successfully applied in 10 patients. An excellent reproduction of the virtual pre-planning has been achieved. Conclusions: We describe a virtual pre-planning technique using a multi-interstitial and endocavitary perineal template. It is based on a virtual work with MRI images. This procedure has shown to be feasible and efficient in clinical practice by facilitating the work of specialists, and reducing uncertainties of the application.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From December 2005 to October 2015, we retrospectively analyzed 34 patients treated with MUPIT and 25 treated with the TB. Six 4 Gy fractions were prescribed to the clinical target volume (CTV) combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The organs at risk (OARs) and the CTV were delineated by CT scan in the MUPIT implants and by MRI in the TB implants. Dosimetry was CT-based for MUPIT and exclusively MRI-based for TB. Dose values were biologically normalized to equivalent doses in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). RESULTS: Median CTV volumes were 163.5 cm3 for CT-based MUPIT (range 81.8-329.4 cm3) and 91.9 cm3 for MRI-based TB (range 26.2-161 cm3). Median D90 CTV (EBRT + BT) was 75.8 Gy for CT-based MUPIT (range 69-82 Gy) and 78.6 Gy for MRI-based TB (range 62.5-84.2 Gy). Median D2cm3 for the rectum was 75.3 Gy for CT-based MUPIT (range 69.8-132.1 Gy) and 69.9 Gy for MRI-based TB (range 58.3-83.7 Gy). Median D2cm3 for the bladder was 79.8 Gy for CT-based MUPIT (range 71.2-121.1 Gy) and 77.1 Gy for MRI-based TB (range 60.5-90.8 Gy). Local control (LC) was 88\%. Overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), and LC were not statistically significant in either group. Patients treated with CT-based MUPIT had a significantly higher percentage of rectal bleeding G3 (p = 0.040) than those treated with MRI-based TB, 13\% vs. 2\%. CONCLUSIONS: Template Benidorm treatment using MRI-based dosimetry provides advantages of MRI volume definition, and allows definition of smaller volumes that result in statistically significant decreased rectal toxicity compared to that seen with CT-based MUPIT treatment.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis of 19 patients who received VBT as the sole adjuvant treatment was undertaken. For the purposes of the study, every VBT fraction was re-segmented and re-planned under the same conditions. CT-planning images were registered, initially following a rigid method and then using deformable registration. The transformation vectors were reused to warp the dose files, followed by the dose summation. Three dose accumulation scenarios were studied: (1) an SP approach, (2) a rigid dose warping summation (RDWS), (3) a deformable dose warping summation (DDWS). Each scenario was analyzed for 3 and 5 fractions to evaluate the effect of fractionation. D0.1cc, D1cc, D2cc, D5cc, D5\%, and Dmean values were compared for organs at risk, such as the rectum and bladder. RESULTS: No statistical significances were observed in rectal parameters between SP and RDWS or between SP and DDWS. Significant SP, RDWS and DDWS Dmean, D0.1cc, and D2cc metric differences for the 5 fractions bladder scenario were observed (p = 0.0242, 0.0196, and 0.0242, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A multi-image planning procedure for a VBT course leads to limited differences between different summation methods. SP is an effective and acceptable surrogate for absorbed doses in organs at risk.},

Despite its advantage, one of the main obstacles preventing a transition to an MRI-only workflow is that implanted plastic catheters are not reliably visualized on MR images. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a deep-learning-based algorithm for semiautomatic reconstruction of interstitial catheters during an MR-only workflow. MR images of 20 gynecological patients were used in this study. Note that 360 catheters were reconstructed using T1- and T2-weighted images by five experienced brachytherapy planners. The mean of the five reconstructed paths were used for training (257 catheters), validation (15 catheters), and testing/evaluation (88 catheters). To automatically identify and localize the catheters, a two-dimensional (2D) U-net algorithm was used to find their approximate location in each image slice. Once localized, thresholding was applied to those regions to find the extrema, as catheters appear as bright and dark regions in T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. The localized dwell positions of the proposed algorithm were compared to the ground truth reconstruction. Reconstruction time was also evaluated. A total of 34 009 catheter dwell positions were evaluated between the algorithm and all planners to estimate the reconstruction variability. The average variation was 0.97 {$\pm$} 0.66 mm. The average reconstruction time for this approach was 11 {$\pm$} 1 min, compared with 46 {$\pm$} 10 min for the expert planners. This study suggests that the proposed deep learning, MR-based framework has potential to replace the conventional manual catheter reconstruction. The adoption of this approach in the brachytherapy workflow is expected to improve treatment efficiency while reducing planning time, resources, and human errors.},

Despite its benefit, one of the main challenges toward MRI-only workflows is that the implanted catheters are not reliably visualized on MR images. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of MR-only workflow using an in-house MR line marker during interstitial gynecological high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients diagnosed with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with HDR brachytherapy were included in this study. The hybrid CT/MR-treated plan was used as the study reference plan. Five users manually reconstructed the catheter's path on MR images (3D T1- and T2-weighted). Subsequently, the dwell positions from the users' plans were superimposed on the reference plans to evaluate the dosimetric impact of the using MR-only for catheter reconstruction in comparison with hybrid CT/MR approach. Variability of dwell positions between users and reconstruction time was also evaluated. RESULTS: More than 96.90\% of catheter reconstruction variations were {$<$} 2 mm. No statistical differences were reported between MR-only and hybrid CT/MR in gross tumor volume D98 and high-risk clinical target volume D90, respectively. For the OARs (bladder, sigmoid, rectum, and bowel), no significant changes were observed in any dose metrics between MR-only and hybrid CT/MR. The average reconstruction time was 51 {$\pm$} 10 minutes across all ten patients. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of MR-only workflow using MR line marker during interstitial gynecological HDR brachytherapy has been validated in this study. The results show that the MR-only workflow is equivalent to the conventional hybrid CT/MR approach in terms of gross tumor volume and high-risk clinical target volume coverage and respecting of OARs dose limits.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurately delineating clinical target volumes (CTV) is essential for completing radiotherapy plans but is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inter-observer variation. Automating CTV delineation has the benefits of both speeding up contouring process and improving the quality of contours. Recently, auto-segmentation approaches based on deep learning have achieved some improvements. However, unlike organ segmentation, the CTV contains potential tumor spread tissues or subclinical disease tissues, resulting in poorly defined margin interface and irregular shape. It is not reasonable to directly apply the deep learning segmentation algorithms to CTV tasks without considering the unique characteristics of shape and margin. In this work, we propose a novel automatic CTV delineation algorithm based on deep learning addressing the unique shape and margin challenges. METHODS: Our deep learning method, called RA-CTVNet, segments the CTV from cervical cancer CT images. RA-CTVNet denotes our automatic CTV delineation algorithm based on deep learning with Area-aware reweight strategy and Recursive refinement strategy. (1) In order to process the whole-volume CT images and delineate all CTVs in one shot, our method is built upon the popular 3D Unet architecture. We further extend it with robust residual learning and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for better feature representation. (2) We propose area-aware reweight strategy which assigns different weights for different slices. The core is adjusting model's attention to each slice. (3) In terms of the trade-off between providing performance improvements and meeting the limitations of GPU memory, we exploit a new recursive refinement strategy to address margin challenge. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 462 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer who received radiotherapy from June 2017 to May 2019. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate performance of RA-CTVNet. First, compared to different network architectures, RA-CTVNet achieved improvements in Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Second, we conducted ablation study. The results showed that compared to the backbone, area-aware reweight strategy increased DSC by 3.3\% on average and recursive refinement strategy further increased DSC by 1.6\% on average. Then, we compared our method with three human experts. Our RA-CTVNet performed better than two experts while comparably to the third expert. Finally, a multicenter evaluation was conducted to verify the accuracy and generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that deep learning is able to offer an efficient framework for automatic CTV delineation. The tailored RA-CTVNet can improve the quality of CTV contours, which has great potential for reducing the burden of experts and increasing the accuracy of delineation. In the future, if with more training data, further improvements are possible, bringing this approach closer to real clinical practice.},

The recent developments in high-dose rate remote afterloaders, modern applicators, treatment-planning software, image guidance, and dose monitoring systems have led to improvement in the local control rates and in some cases improved the survival rates. The development of these highly advanced and complicated treatment modalities has been accompanied by challenges, which have made the existence of quality assurance protocols a must to ensure the integrity of the treatment process. Quality assurance aims at standardizing the technical and clinical procedures involved in the treatment of patients, which could eventually decrease the source of uncertainties whether technical (source/equipment related) or clinical. This commentary review sheds light (from a clinical point of view) on some potential sources of uncertainties associated with the use of modern brachytherapy in the treatment of gynecological cancers.},

This is the first comprehensive report on clinical outcome in a large multi-institutional cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From twelve centres 731 patients, treated with definitive EBRT{$\pm$}concurrent chemotherapy followed by IGBT, were analysed. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 3/5years were calculated for local control (LC, primary endpoint), pelvic control (PC), overall survival (OS), cancer specific survival (CSS). In 610 patients, G3-4 late toxicity (CTCAEv3.0) was reported. RESULTS: Median follow up was 43months, percent of patients per FIGO stage IA/IB/IIA 22.8\%, IIB 50.4\%, IIIA-IVB 26.8\%. 84.8\% had squamous cell carcinomas; 40.5\% lymph node involvement. Mean EBRT dose was 46{$\pm$}2.5Gy; 77.4\% received concurrent chemotherapy. Mean D90 HRCTV was 87{$\pm$}15Gy (EQD2(10)), mean D2cc was: bladder 81{$\pm$}22Gy, rectum 64{$\pm$}9Gy, sigmoid 66{$\pm$}10Gy and bowel 64{$\pm$}9Gy (all EQD2(3)). The 3/5-year actuarial LC, PC, CSS, OS were 91\%/89\%, 87\%/84\%, 79\%/73\%, 74\%/65\%. Actuarial LC at 3/5years for IB, IIB, IIIB was 98\%/98\%, 93\%/91\%, 79\%/75\%. Actuarial PC at 3/5years for IB, IIB, IIIB was 96\%/96\%, 89\%/87\%, 73\%/67\%. Actuarial 5-year G3-G5 morbidity was 5\%, 7\%, 5\% for bladder, gastrointestinal tract, vagina. CONCLUSION: IGBT combined with radio-chemotherapy leads to excellent LC (91\%), PC (87\%), OS (74\%), CSS (79\%) with limited severe morbidity.},

Contour propagation between individual fractions and dose accumulation can be useful for cervix cancer radiotherapy. Contour mapping and applicator reconstruction with rigid registration based on the applicator geometry provide good accuracy. However, deformable image registration is particularly challenging in the pelvic region, due to the large and complex deformations caused by tumor shrinkage, bladder and rectum filling, insertion of a brachytherapy applicator and presence of packing material. This causes substantial limitations and uncertainties when using it in the clinical workflow so that the current generation of deformable image registration algorithms is not yet robust enough to handle complexities involving the dose accumulation of external beam and brachytherapy. The direct addition of doses provides a reasonable estimate of the total absorbed dose. However, in case of significant dose gradients from external beam boosts or midline-shielding adding dose contributions from the different radiotherapy modalities and fractions remains subject to large uncertainties.},

Material and methods Dose plans were analysed for 20 cervical cancer patients with MRI based brachytherapy. Uncertainty of applicator reconstruction was modelled by translating and rotating the applicator. Changes in DVH parameters per mm of applicator displacement were evaluated for GTV, CTV, bladder, rectum, and sigmoid. These data were used to derive patient population based estimates of delivered dose relative to expected dose. Results Deviations of DVH parameters depend on direction of reconstruction uncertainty. The most sensitive organs are rectum and bladder where mean DVH parameter shifts are 5\textendash 6\% per mm applicator displacement in ant\textendash post direction. For other directions and other DVH parameters, mean shifts are below 4\% per mm. By avoiding systematic reconstruction errors, uncertainties on DVH parameters can be kept below 10\% in 90\% of a patient population. Systematic errors of a few millimetres can lead to significant deviations. Conclusion Comprehensive quality control of afterloader, applicators and imaging procedures should be applied to prevent systematic errors in applicator reconstruction. Random errors should be minimised by using small slice thickness. With careful reconstruction procedures, reliable DVH parameters for target and OAR's can be obtained.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The dose distributions obtained from three imaging approaches for target delineation in cervical cancer using high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy were investigated. Material and methods: Ten cervical cancer patients receiving four fractions of HDR brachytherapy were enrolled. Based on different imaging approaches, three brachytherapy plans were developed for each patient: with the high-risk clinical target volume (HRCTV) delineated on magnetic resonance (MRI) images for every fraction (approach A; MRI-only); on MRI for the first fraction and computed tomography (CT) images for the subsequent fractions (approach B; MRI1st/CT); and on CT images for all fractions (approach C; CT-only). The volume, height, width at point A, width at maximum level, and dosimetric parameters (D100, D98, D95, and D90 of the HRCTV; and D0.1cc, D1cc, and D2cc of all organs at risk, or organ at risk - OAR: bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, and bowel) provided by each approach were compared. Results: The mean HRCTV volume, width, and height obtained from approach C (CT-only) were overestimated compared to those from approaches A (MRI-only) and B (MRI1st/CT). The doses to the HRCTV for approaches A and B were similar. However, the HRCTV doses for approach C were significantly lower than those for approaches A and B for all parameters (D95-D100). As to the OAR, the three approaches showed no differences. Conclusions: A combination of MRI and CT is a safe alternative approach for cervical cancer HDR brachytherapy. The technique provides comparable dosimetric outcomes to MRI-based planning, while being more cost-effective.},

Navigation is based on preoperative or intraoperative imaging combined with 3-dimensional position tracking of interventional tools registered to the images. Research of navigation technology in medical interventions requires significant engineering efforts. The difficulty of developing such complex systems has been limiting the clinical translation of new methods and ideas. A key to the future success of this field is to provide researchers with platforms that allow rapid implementation of applications with minimal resources spent on reimplementing existing system features. A number of platforms have been already developed that can share data in real time through standard interfaces. Complete navigation systems can be built using these platforms using a layered software architecture. In this paper, we review the most popular platforms, and show an effective way to take advantage of them through an example surgical navigation application.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of dwell position detection with a combined electromagnetic tracking (EMT) brachytherapy (BT) system for treatment verification, by quantifying positional errors due to EM field interference in typical pelvic BT clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dedicated prostate and cervix BT phantoms were imaged with CT. For the cervix phantom, the Utrecht applicator + interstitial catheters were used. The implants were reconstructed and treatment plans were created with 270/65 dwell positions for the prostate/cervix phantom. Next, EMT experiments were performed in clinical BT settings using a prototype of a combined EMT/BT system. We quantified positional errors due to EM field interference from surrounding equipment by comparing planned and EMT-measured dwell positions. The mean residual error between planned and EMT-measured dwell positions was calculated in the prostate interstitial catheters and in the whole cervix implant including the applicator. For the cervix phantom, the analysis was repeated for only the interstitial catheters. RESULTS: Mean residual errors of less than 0.5/0.4 mm in the prostate/cervix catheters were found. For the whole cervix implant including the applicator, large deviations up to 2.4 mm were found. Compared to the interference free set-up, the CT and patient bed environments showed larger residual errors in the interstitial catheters, but residual errors remained {$<$}1 mm in all cases. CONCLUSION: Dwell position detection with the combined system in interstitial catheters is sufficiently accurate to perform EMT-based treatment verification. The effect of EM interference from the surrounding equipment was limited.},

Material and methods: All patients had a CT, MRI and pelvic-paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Treatment: pelvic (+/-)para-aortic3D/IMRT radiotherapy (45 Gy), weekly cisplatin and HDR-B and pelvic node/parametrial boost 60 Gy until interstitial brachytherapy was done. Two implants: 2008-2011: 5 fractions of 6 Gy, 2011: 2016, 4 fractions of 7 Gy. MRI/TAC were done in each implant. The following were defined: GTV, CTH-HR, CTV-IR; OAR: rectum, bladder and sigmoid.

  abstract = {Purpose To describe the potential clinical use of a new brachytherapy applicator for gynecological tumors, with special attention to locally advanced cervical carcinoma. This device allows the combination of intracavitary radiotherapy and MRI-compatible transperineal interstitial needles. The design of this template addresses the disadvantages of currently commercially available templates: the inability of the intracavitary component to reach deep into the cervix (MUPIT), and the MRI-incompatibility of these templates (MUPIT and Syed), which necessitates use of CT imaging for the dosimetry. Material and methods The newly developed Benidorm Template applicator allows titanium needles in a template with straight and angled holes to provide different angles of divergence to be used with currently existing MRI-compatible intrauterine tubes. It can provide total coverage of the craniocaudal and lateral extension of the tumor (intrautherus, parametrial, and paravaginal). This method is mainly indicated in advanced cervical carcinoma with bulky parametrial invasion (medial or distal), with bulky primary disease that responds poorly to external beam radiotherapy extensive paravaginal involvement (tumor thickness greater than 0.5 cm) extending to the middle or lower third of the vagina, or for disease that has invaded the bladder or rectum (stage IVA). Results Between April 2013 until December 2014, we treated 15 patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma employing the Benidorm Template. The median dose at D90 for the CTV was 79.8 Gy (71.5-89.9 Gy), at D2cc for the bladder it was 77.6 Gy (69.8-90.8 Gy), and at D2cc for the rectum it was 71.9 Gy (58.3-83.7 Gy). Values expressed in EQD2, assuming {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} of 10 for CTV and 3 for OAR. Conclusions This new applicator allows the use of MRI-based dosimetry, thus providing the advantages of MRI volume definition. As such, it facilitates determination of complete intracavitary and interstitial CTV coverage and the sparing of normal tissues.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the contours and dose-volume histograms (DVH) of the tumor and organs at risk (OAR) with computed tomography (CT) vs. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cervical cancer brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients underwent both MRI and CT after applicator insertion. The dose received by at least 90\% of the volume (D(90)), the minimal target dose (D(100)), the volume treated to the prescription dose or greater for tumor for the high-risk (HR) and intermediate-risk (IR) clinical target volume (CTV) and the dose to 0.1 cm3, 1 cm3, and 2 cm3 for the OARs were evaluated. A standardized approach to contouring on CT (CT(Std)) was developed, implemented (HR- and IR-CTV(CTStd)), and compared with the MRI contours. RESULTS: Tumor height, thickness, and total volume measurements, as determined by either CT or CT(Std) were not significantly different compared with the MRI volumes. In contrast, the width measurements differed in HR-CTV(CTStd) (p = 0.05) and IR-CTV(CTStd) (p = 0.01). For the HR-CTV(CTStd), this resulted in statistically significant differences in the volume treated to the prescription dose or greater (MRI, 96\% vs. CT(Std), 86\%, p = 0.01), D(100) (MRI, 5.4 vs. CT(Std), 3.4, p {$<$}0.01), and D(90) (MRI, 8.7 vs. CT(Std), 6.7, p {$<$}0.01). Correspondingly, the IR-CTV DVH values on MRI vs. CT(Std), differed in the D(100) (MRI, 3.0 vs. CT(Std), 2.2, p = 0.01) and D(90) (MRI, 5.6 vs. CT(Std), 4.6, p = 0.02). The MRI and CT DVH values of the dose to 0.1 cm3, 1 cm3, and 2 cm3 for the OARs were similar. CONCLUSION: Computed tomography-based or MRI-based scans at brachytherapy are adequate for OAR DVH analysis. However, CT tumor contours can significantly overestimate the tumor width, resulting in significant differences in the D(90), D(100), and volume treated to the prescription dose or greater for the HR-CTV compared with that using MRI. MRI remains the standard for CTV definition.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy is one of the most effective ways to treat the prostate cancer, which is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. This treatment delivers highly conformal dose through the transperineal needle implants and is guided by a real time ultrasound (US) imaging system. Currently, the brachytherapy needles in the US images are manually segmented by physicists during the treatment, which is time consuming and error prone. In this study, we propose a set of deep learning-based algorithms to accurately segment the brachytherapy needles and locate the needle tips from the US images. METHODS: Two deep neural networks are developed to address this problem. First, a modified deep U-Net is used to segment the pixels belonging to the brachytherapy needles from the US images. Second, an additional VGG-16-based deep convolutional network is combined with the segmentation network to predict the locations of the needle tips. The networks are trained and evaluated on a clinical US images dataset with labeled needle trajectories collected in our hospital (Institutional Review Board approval (IRB 41755)). RESULTS: The evaluation results show that our method can accurately extract the trajectories of the needles with a resolution of 0.668 mm and 0.319 mm in x and y direction, respectively. 95.4\% of the x direction and 99.2\% of the y direction have error {$\leq$} 2 mm. Moreover, the position resolutions of the tips are 0.721, 0.369, and 1.877 mm in x, y, and z directions, respectively, while 94.2\%, 98.3\%, and 67.5\% of the data have error {$\leq$} 2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposed a neural network-based algorithm to segment the brachytherapy needles from the US images and locate the needle tip. It can be used in the HDR brachytherapy to help improve the efficiency and quality of the treatments.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the accuracy of a deep learning-based auto-segmentation mode to that of manual contouring by one medical resident, where both entities tried to mimic the delineation 'habits' of the same clinical senior physician. Methods This study included 125 cervical cancer patients whose clinical target volumes (CTVs) and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated by the same senior physician. Of these 125 cases, 100 were used for model training and the remaining 25 for model testing. In addition, the medical resident instructed by the senior physician for approximately 8 months delineated the CTVs and OARs for the testing cases. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the Hausdorff Distance (HD) were used to evaluate the delineation accuracy for CTV, bladder, rectum, small intestine, femoral-head-left, and femoral-head-right. Results The DSC values of the auto-segmentation model and manual contouring by the resident were, respectively, 0.86 and 0.83 for the CTV (P {$<$} 0.05), 0.91 and 0.91 for the bladder (P {$>$} 0.05), 0.88 and 0.84 for the femoral-head-right (P {$<$} 0.05), 0.88 and 0.84 for the femoral-head-left (P {$<$} 0.05), 0.86 and 0.81 for the small intestine (P {$<$} 0.05), and 0.81 and 0.84 for the rectum (P {$>$} 0.05). The HD (mm) values were, respectively, 14.84 and 18.37 for the CTV (P {$<$} 0.05), 7.82 and 7.63 for the bladder (P {$>$} 0.05), 6.18 and 6.75 for the femoral-head-right (P {$>$} 0.05), 6.17 and 6.31 for the femoral-head-left (P {$>$} 0.05), 22.21 and 26.70 for the small intestine (P {$>$} 0.05), and 7.04 and 6.13 for the rectum (P {$>$} 0.05). The auto-segmentation model took approximately 2 min to delineate the CTV and OARs while the resident took approximately 90 min to complete the same task. Conclusion The auto-segmentation model was as accurate as the medical resident but with much better efficiency in this study. Furthermore, the auto-segmentation approach offers additional perceivable advantages of being consistent and ever improving when compared with manual approaches.},

A novel three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed and referred to as DSD-UNET. The dataset of 91 patients received CT-based BT of cervical cancer was used to train and test DSD-UNET model for auto-segmentation of high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Automatic applicator reconstruction was achieved with DSD-UNET-based segmentation of applicator components followed by 3D skeletonization and polynomial curve fitting. Digitization of the channel paths for tandem and ovoid applicator in the planning CT was evaluated utilizing the data from 32 patients. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy. The segmentation performance of DSD-UNET was compared with that of 3D U-Net. Results showed that DSD-UNET method outperformed 3D U-Net on segmentations of all the structures. The mean DSC values of DSD-UNET method were 86.9\%, 82.9\%, and 82.1\% for bladder, HR-CTV, and rectum, respectively. For the performance of automatic applicator reconstruction, outstanding segmentation accuracy was first achieved for the intrauterine and ovoid tubes (average DSC value of 92.1\%, average HD value of 2.3 mm). Finally, HDs between the channel paths determined automatically and manually were 0.88 {$\pm$} 0.12 mm, 0.95 {$\pm$} 0.16 mm, and 0.96 {$\pm$} 0.15 mm for the intrauterine, left ovoid, and right ovoid tubes, respectively. The proposed DSD-UNET method outperformed the 3D U-Net and could segment HR-CTV, bladder, and rectum with relatively good accuracy. Accurate digitization of the channel paths could be achieved with the DSD-UNET-based method. The proposed approaches could be useful to improve the efficiency and consistency of treatment planning for cervical cancer BT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Ultrasound (US)-guided high dose rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy requests the clinicians to place HDR needles (catheters) into the prostate gland under transrectal US (TRUS) guidance in the operating room. The quality of the subsequent radiation treatment plan is largely dictated by the needle placements, which varies upon the experience level of the clinicians and the procedure protocols. Real-time plan dose distribution, if available, could be a vital tool to provide more subjective assessment of the needle placements, hence potentially improving the radiation plan quality and the treatment outcome. However, due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in US imaging, real-time multi-needle segmentation in 3D TRUS, which is the major obstacle for real-time dose mapping, has not been realized to date. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method that enables accurate and real-time digitization of the multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy. METHODS: A deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture was developed to segment multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images. Attention gates were considered in our model to improve the prediction on the small needle points. Furthermore, the spatial continuity of needles was encoded into our model with total variation (TV) regularization. The combined network was trained on 3D TRUS patches with the deep supervision strategy, where the binary needle annotation images were provided as ground truth. The trained network was then used to localize and segment the HDR needles for a new patient's TRUS images. We evaluated our proposed method based on the needle shaft and tip errors against manually defined ground truth and compared our method with other state-of-art methods (U-Net and deeply supervised attention U-Net). RESULTS: Our method detected 96\% needles of 339 needles from 23 HDR prostate brachytherapy patients with 0.290 {$\pm$} 0.236 mm at shaft error and 0.442 {$\pm$} 0.831 mm at tip error. For shaft localization, our method resulted in 96\% localizations with less than 0.8 mm error (needle diameter is 1.67 mm), while for tip localization, our method resulted in 75\% needles with 0 mm error and 21\% needles with 2 mm error (TRUS image slice thickness is 2 mm). No significant difference is observed (P = 0.83) on tip localization between our results with the ground truth. Compared with U-Net and deeply supervised attention U-Net, the proposed method delivers a significant improvement on both shaft error and tip error (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a new segmentation method to precisely localize the tips and shafts of multiple needles in 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy. The 3D rendering of the needles could help clinicians to evaluate the needle placements. It paves the way for the development of real-time plan dose assessment tools that can further elevate the quality and outcome of HDR prostate brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In real-time trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-based high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, the accurate identification of needle-tip position is critical for treatment planning and delivery. Currently, needle-tip identification on ultrasound images can be subject to large uncertainty and errors because of ultrasound image quality and imaging artifacts. To address this problem, we developed a method based on physical measurements with simple and practical implementation to improve the accuracy and robustness of needle-tip identification. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our method uses measurements of the residual needle length and an off-line pre-established coordinate transformation factor, to calculate the needle-tip position on the TRUS images. The transformation factor was established through a one-time systematic set of measurements of the probe and template holder positions, applicable to all patients. To compare the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and the conventional method (ultrasound detection), based on the gold-standard X-ray fluoroscopy, extensive measurements were conducted in water and gel phantoms. RESULTS: In water phantom, our method showed an average tip-detection accuracy of 0.7 mm compared with 1.6 mm of the conventional method. In gel phantom (more realistic and tissue-like), our method maintained its level of accuracy while the uncertainty of the conventional method was 3.4mm on average with maximum values of over 10mm because of imaging artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: A novel method based on simple physical measurements was developed to accurately detect the needle-tip position for TRUS-based high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy. The method demonstrated much improved accuracy and robustness over the conventional method.},

  abstract = {Deformable image registration (DIR) of fractional high-dose-rate (HDR) CT images is challenging due to the presence of applicators in the brachytherapy image. Point-to-point correspondence fails because of the undesired deformation vector fields (DVF) propagated from the applicator region (AR) to the surrounding tissues, which can potentially introduce significant DIR errors in dose mapping. This paper proposes a novel segmentation and point-matching enhanced efficient DIR (named SPEED) scheme to facilitate dose accumulation among HDR treatment fractions. In SPEED, a semi-automatic seed point generation approach is developed to obtain the incremented fore/background point sets to feed the random walks algorithm, which is used to segment and remove the AR, leaving empty AR cavities in the HDR CT images. A feature-based 'thin-plate-spline robust point matching' algorithm is then employed for AR cavity surface points matching. With the resulting mapping, a DVF defining on each voxel is estimated by B-spline approximation, which serves as the initial DVF for the subsequent Demons-based DIR between the AR-free HDR CT images. The calculated DVF via Demons combined with the initial one serve as the final DVF to map doses between HDR fractions. The segmentation and registration accuracy are quantitatively assessed by nine clinical HDR cases from three gynecological cancer patients. The quantitative analysis and visual inspection of the DIR results indicate that SPEED can suppress the impact of applicator on DIR, and accurately register HDR CT images as well as deform and add interfractional HDR doses.},

  abstract = {BackgroundRadiomic features may quantify characteristics present in medical imaging. However, the lack of standardized definitions and validated reference values have hampered clinical use.PurposeTo standardize a set of 174 radiomic features.Materials and MethodsRadiomic features were assessed in three phases. In phase I, 487 features were derived from the basic set of 174 features. Twenty-five research teams with unique radiomics software implementations computed feature values directly from a digital phantom, without any additional image processing. In phase II, 15 teams computed values for 1347 derived features using a CT image of a patient with lung cancer and predefined image processing configurations. In both phases, consensus among the teams on the validity of tentative reference values was measured through the frequency of the modal value and classified as follows: less than three matches, weak; three to five matches, moderate; six to nine matches, strong; 10 or more matches, very strong. In the final phase (phase III), a public data set of multimodality images (CT, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) from 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma was used to prospectively assess reproducibility of standardized features.ResultsConsensus on reference values was initially weak for 232 of 302 features (76.8\%) at phase I and 703 of 1075 features (65.4\%) at phase II. At the final iteration, weak consensus remained for only two of 487 features (0.4\%) at phase I and 19 of 1347 features (1.4\%) at phase II. Strong or better consensus was achieved for 463 of 487 features (95.1\%) at phase I and 1220 of 1347 features (90.6\%) at phase II. Overall, 169 of 174 features were standardized in the first two phases. In the final validation phase (phase III), most of the 169 standardized features could be excellently reproduced (166 with CT; 164 with PET; and 164 with MRI).ConclusionA set of 169 radiomics features was standardized, which enabled verification and calibration of different radiomics software.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2020Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Kuhl and Truhn in this issue.},
