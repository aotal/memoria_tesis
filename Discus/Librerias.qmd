Traditionally, reconstruction methods based on applicator libraries are not used in cases involving interstitial components, because the whole applicator may not be considered rigid and the needle arrangement is patient dependent. However, we think that this option would be helpful in treatment planning procedures. Therefore, in this work, we present a method to include interstitial applicators in the Oncentra TPS library, and we describe a reconstruction method for planning purposes.

In case of the Utrecht applicator, the lack of dummies makes setting the needles challenging. Locating needle tips is essential to accurately determine the maximum source-to-indexer distance; however, the black line available on T2 MRI makes this determination very difficult. Prior to the development of the library presented in this work, we used the following procedure in Utrecht applicator reconstruction: 1) the positions of the catheters of the tandem and ovoid were determined from that of the existing saline dummy; 2) needles were reconstructed using the methodology described in Perez-Calatayud et al. [20]. Briefly, this consisted of using insertion depth information, i.e., the depth from the ovoid’s surface to the needle tip, provided by the radiation oncologist. Then a software ruler set to the insertion depth was placed on the reconstructed plane and used to define the different catheter points, including the needle tips. As was reported previously [20], the insertion depth reproduced using the software ruler, corresponds to the distance from the ovoid’s surface but with an offset of –0.7 cm, to account for the maximum source-to-indexer distance of 129 cm in the afterloader (microSelectron, version 2 or 3 from Elekta). This procedure is laborious and involves some amount of uncertainty in setting the exit point of the needle from the ovoid together with the assumption that the needle is perfectly straight.

In our opinion, the use of the library we have developed significantly improves efficiency. First, a virtual applicator can be selected according to the needle depths; the tandem and ovoids can be quickly set because the rigid applicator structure allows the use of dummies and applicator’s cursive. Once the ovoids are established, the needles exit points can be obtained and only slight corrections are needed to adjust their position according to their signal void at the tip boundaries.

To assess the improvement in accuracy, both reconstruction methods have been used in three different plans. One of the benefit of the new proposed method is evidenced with the more precise tip determination for both catheters, tandem, and ovoid, improving the 2-mm uncertainty due to the partial volume effect because the MRI slice thickness. In the case of needles, the proposed method reduces previous uncertainties of about 2 mm on the exit point from the ovoid, and up to 5 mm at needle tip. Larger deviations on needle tip determination are due to the assumption of perfectly straight needles. By using the developed library, it is also possible to blend the virtual needle to better fit curved trajectories of the real one.

In the case of the TB, which uses titanium needles, the reconstruction can usually be based on needle artifacts that can be seen in T1 MRI sequences, using the void at the tip as the needle tip position. Nevertheless, tissues surrounding the needles can present heterogeneities that complicate the accurate identification of these artifact patterns, and this difficulty is more pronounced in T2 sequences, which is the preferred sequence for contouring.

Before we had the library solution proposed here, we did TB reconstruction as previously described [18]. Briefly, this method is based on knowing the free needle lengths and the positions of typical MRI pellet markers. Template Benidorm uses three small A-vitamin pellets which are hyper-intense on MRI images), compressed by both applicator plates to define the central plane of the plates’ arrangement. Typically, needles 20 cm in length are used. Two points are selected on each needle to define the straight line. From such line and the plane data, the intersection can be obtained. Then, using the free length (knowing the offset distance), the coordinates of the needle tips can be obtained. This method requires an external spreadsheet to compute the tip and plate needle coordinates to be introduced into the Oncentra TPS. Although this procedure is usable, identifying the positions of large numbers of needles is time consuming.

With the new method presented here, the time required to identify needle positions is greatly reduced, at least up to 50%. The virtual applicator with the required needle depth is selected in Oncentra and, using the three A-vitamin pellets as guides, is set on the MRI T2 image study. Then each needle orientation is set using just an axial plane image, in which the void at the tip of the titanium needle is clearly visible with good contrast. Typically, just two axial planes are sufficient to set all the needles. The advantages of this approach for the TB are the time savings (we estimated it in at least around 50%, averaging the time benefice in different cases and different physicist) and the reduction of the probability of catheter misidentification, which can be an issue because of the large numbers of needles number typically used in clinical practice (minimum 14 needles).

The method proposed here is specific for the Oncentra TPS, and also the Elekta Utrecht and TB applicators. However, it can be adapted to other TPS and interstitial applicators taking into account their specific applicator library management. For example, this methodology is currently being developed also for the TPS Sagiplan (Eckert & Ziegler, Bebig, Germany). In Sagiplan, there is a set of pieces (called cursive), with which we compose the applicators (called cursive). Inside each cluster configuration, we obtain the relative position between all of pieces that conform that cluster. So, in an example of an applicator with an interstitial part, as Vienna applicator [11], with a 3D model with the output points of needles perfectly determined, we could configure a similar system as described above. There is a work in progress within this project.
