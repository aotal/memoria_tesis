Traditionally, reconstruction methods based on applicator libraries are not used in cases involving interstitial components, because the whole applicator may not be considered rigid and the needle arrangement is patient dependent. However, we think that this option would be helpful in treatment planning procedures. Therefore, in this work, we present a method to include interstitial applicators in the Oncentra TPS library, and we describe a reconstruction method for planning purposes.

In case of the Utrecht applicator, the lack of dummies makes setting the needles challenging. Locating needle tips is essential to accurately determine the maximum source-to-indexer distance; however, the black line available on T2 MRI makes this determination very difficult. Prior to the development of the library presented in this work, we used the following procedure in Utrecht applicator reconstruction: 1) the positions of the catheters of the tandem and ovoid were determined from that of the existing saline dummy; 2) needles were reconstructed using the methodology described in Perez-Calatayud et al. [20]. Briefly, this consisted of using insertion depth information, i.e., the depth from the ovoid’s surface to the needle tip, provided by the radiation oncologist. Then a software ruler set to the insertion depth was placed on the reconstructed plane and used to define the different catheter points, including the needle tips. As was reported previously [20], the insertion depth reproduced using the software ruler, corresponds to the distance from the ovoid’s surface but with an offset of –0.7 cm, to account for the maximum source-to-indexer distance of 129 cm in the afterloader (microSelectron, version 2 or 3 from Elekta). This procedure is laborious and involves some amount of uncertainty in setting the exit point of the needle from the ovoid together with the assumption that the needle is perfectly straight.

In our opinion, the use of the library we have developed significantly improves efficiency. First, a virtual applicator can be selected according to the needle depths; the tandem and ovoids can be quickly set because the rigid applicator structure allows the use of dummies and applicator’s cursive. Once the ovoids are established, the needles exit points can be obtained and only slight corrections are needed to adjust their position according to their signal void at the tip boundaries.

To assess the improvement in accuracy, both reconstruction methods have been used in three different plans. One of the benefit of the new proposed method is evidenced with the more precise tip determination for both catheters, tandem, and ovoid, improving the 2-mm uncertainty due to the partial volume effect because the MRI slice thickness. In the case of needles, the proposed method reduces previous uncertainties of about 2 mm on the exit point from the ovoid, and up to 5 mm at needle tip. Larger deviations on needle tip determination are due to the assumption of perfectly straight needles. By using the developed library, it is also possible to blend the virtual needle to better fit curved trajectories of the real one.

In the case of the TB, which uses titanium needles, the reconstruction can usually be based on needle artifacts that can be seen in T1 MRI sequences, using the void at the tip as the needle tip position. Nevertheless, tissues surrounding the needles can present heterogeneities that complicate the accurate identification of these artifact patterns, and this difficulty is more pronounced in T2 sequences, which is the preferred sequence for contouring.

Before we had the library solution proposed here, we did TB reconstruction as previously described [18]. Briefly, this method is based on knowing the free needle lengths and the positions of typical MRI pellet markers. Template Benidorm uses three small A-vitamin pellets.
