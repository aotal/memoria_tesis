The developed Java application presents a friendly user interface, as is showed in Figure 2. The user can select the needles efficiently (both straight and divergent) to be included together with the free length, and then their depth. This information is incorporated automatically into the applicator library. The pre-brachytherapy MRI is performed in T2 mode, which is recommended for contouring. Once the specific virtual number of needles and depths have been selected, a virtual plan is made in Oncentra TPS and optimizing according to the required dosimetry and CTV coverage, the needles “density” (distance within needles) and extension. Figure 3 shows a case of MRI virtual pre-plan and MRI planning for dosimetry. In the virtual plan, the template is reconstructed using the library according to Otal et al. [12]. A rendering view of a virtual plan example is shown in Figure 4, in which the A-vitamin pellets (A1-A3), the needles, and uterine tandem are illustrated.

The virtual pre-plan procedure has significant advantages: needle depth estimation, needle positions and number, the coverage of the CTV being optimized while minimizing doses in organ at risk. “A suboptimal implant can never be transformed into a satisfactory application by any form of treatment planning optimization” [16]. The corrections are limited in cases of a suboptimal dosimetry due to an uncovered treatment volume. Treatment planning, based exclusively on MRI is preferred to other traditionally employed image modalities, like CT or methods combining both MRI and CT. Uncertainties are reduced with exclusive MRI because of the inaccuracies derived from CT-MRI registration procedures [17]. There has been a consequent growing interest in developing fully MRI compatible devices that allow the real-time insertion and guidance of the brachytherapy applicators [18]. Another option is MRI pre-plan. The primary limitation of the pre-plan is the lack of an intrauterine/intracavitary component and the likelihood of divergence of the needles, particularly when rigid needles are not used. The position of the uterus varies in the majority of the patients, being straight after the insertion of the intrauterine tube. The pre-plan can be done with IC component under general [19] or paravaginal [20,21] anesthesia. In spite of a virtual pre-plan, these authors describe one sixth of all needles planned, and implanted as free needles due to the geometrical limitation of tandem/ring and needle applicator [19]. Perineal templates like TB avoids previous limitations due to the use of rigid needles, can add an intrauterine component and can cover all the directions of tumor extension.

This pre-planning procedure has been successfully applied in 10 consecutive patients. An excellent reproduction of the virtual pre-planning has been achieved. When hysterectomized patients are treated, there is only a small change from pre-plan to post-plan. From our experience, in patients without surgery, the needles changes are also small, both in number and position after the insertion (within 5 mm at the tip for a typical depth of 160 mm). The same experienced radiation oncologist (SR) has completed the contouring in both pre- brachytherapy MRI and post-implant MRI. In our opinion, this virtual pre-plan technique can be extended easily to others multi-interstitial applicators like MUPIT or Syed, with an optimized number of needles and appropriate depth. Pre-planning and library allows an easy implant and quick reconstruction that is safe and time saving.
