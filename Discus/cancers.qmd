The main objective of this study is to propose improvements and point out the gaps in the existing TPSs. External software compatible with the TPSs that could help improve the issues outlined here were excluded from the study, including those scripting environments within the TPSs that may allow the user to program personalized tools. As discussed above, this review is based on the clinical expertise of a group of radiation oncologists and medical physicists. Interactive demos provided by the software manufacturers and delivered by specialists from the supplier companies were also used. These specialists were asked to propose solutions to some of the challenges through a questionnaire. Possible limitations of this methodology are the following. It is expert- and specialist-opinion based, therefore personal biases are always a risk. In this case, considering that it is a relatively large group of professionals working in different institutions (different protocols, installations, background, etc.), such an issue is diminished. Another possible limitation is the fact that not all experts have used all TPSs in their clinical practice, something unavoidable considering the realities of clinical practice. The use of questionnaires also might limit the study, since they inherently have selection and sampling biases that might preclude the discovery of unforeseen situations.

In addition, this modest multicentre and multidisciplinary study is fundamentally aimed at pointing out deficiencies and limitations rather than quantifying their consequences.

There is a segmentation software that incorporates more advanced tools for image registration that include utilities for dose summation between different fractions. It would be desirable that such, or similar, tools eventually make their way to the TPSs.

Other tools, this time related to the segmentation of clinical volumes and organs at risk, that would be interesting to incorporate into brachytherapy-specific TPSs would automate such segmentation by means of convolutional neural networks. These are already being incorporated into the clinical workflow in radiotherapy, and there are recent works in the literature explicitly oriented to the cervix case [54–56], although CT is the imaging modality used in these works.

An exciting topic in external beam therapy is the generation of synthetic CTs from MRI. The main objective of the generation of such CTs is to segment tumours and organs at risk in the MRI and obtain the electron densities necessary for dose calculation [57]. These synthetic CT scans could be helpful in the case of cervical brachytherapy and are nowadays an unexplored line of research. The user community has historically developed ‘in-house’ tools that attempt to make up for the shortcomings of the TPSs and cannot typically be incorporated into the planner’s workflow. A commonly known example are spreadsheets. A robust scripting environment in a high-level language would help the users in optimizing their work routines and also be a source of inspiration for companies integrating future product development.

In the last years, several research groups have been working on electromagnetic tracking systems [58–61] to check the trajectory of the brachytherapy source before the treatment delivery. One of the specialists is participating in a project involving such technology. Although its primary purpose is to verify the path followed, it could be used as a self-reconstruction tool in the future. Nowadays, it is not available to users.

Some studies have recently been published investigating the feasibility of deep learning-based algorithms for semi-automated reconstruction of interstitial catheters during MRI-based gynecological HDR [46].
